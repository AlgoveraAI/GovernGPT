There were no indications that this time offUpon further inspection, we noted that his last message posted in the GC chat as well as the DAO server was not since Sep 22 1, over 2 weeks. This is still the case today.I personally reached out via Discord and Telegram, but have still received no reply.With the looming S6 GC election, it dawned on us that the timing of a potential replacement was “ideal” and if Apollo was removed or stepped down, he could be replaced in the same election - preventing a singleton Snapshot election.That kicked off a discussion about the Grants Committee’s internal ability to dismiss fellow members.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" GC Powers\nCould we dismiss a member?At first, the assumption was that we would need to go to Snapshot to add/remove all members, but upon further inspection the S5 Spec 2 only refers to the limitations for adding members: “The Committee cannot change the application process to be a Committee member.”Notably, the GC is “otherwise responsible for their own operations”.The combination of these two facts led us to consider that, so long as quorum could still be met, the GC could dismiss a member with a unanimous vote (excluding the member in question).\n"}

This was because, historically:Many snapshot voters are not engaged in day-to-day operations in the DAO and will miss a lot of context. Simple things like framing language are enough to significantly sway votes.\n\n\nVoter fatigue is real. Too many votes is too much noise. This is reflected in Index Coop 2, which has very low participation on many of their snapshots and is reflected in our own snapshots, with a variance of almost 50% of voters at times.This is consistent with what Boardroom, a governance platform, is noticing as well.twitter.com\n  \n\n  \n    \nKevin Nielsen\n@kevinknielsen\n\n\n  Key learning from building @boardroom_info - voting just ratifies and formalizes changes after rough consensus has been already established\n\n90% of the coordination and decision-making happens beforehand, off-chain\n\nAccess to data ≠ transparency, context is the whole ball game\n\n\n\n  3:41 PM - 27 Oct 2021\n\n    \n      \n        \n      \n      19\n    \n\n    \n      \n        \n      \n      1For these reasons, we have a robust proposal process (unlike Sushiswap that has proposal like this 7) and a seasonal spec that embeds much of our decision into one ratified vote.To align with these values, I’d like to introduce a number of different rules and mechanisms that will help us gather community consensus before moving something to snapshot.SCOPE OF WORKProposes a series of changes to governance that, upon soft consensus will be ratified with an on-chain snapshot vote and subsequently included in each Seasonal Spec thereafter, as parameters are likely to change.SPECIFICATIONWhat Goes to Snapshot?Part of the confusion here is understanding what goes to snapshot and what doesn’t. Historically, we’ve sent the Seasonal Spec to snapshot, along with validating project and guild funding. This is the first time we’ve had a purely tokenomic post gain traction and it wasn’t clear to the community that it would go to snapshot. As such, here are few reasons something should go to snapshot. Please comment if you have further suggestions:Seasonal specification (including Grants Committee allocation) [1] 3 [2] 3\n\n\nSeasonal Project and Guild funding [1] 8\n\n\nMajor Governance changes [1] 1 [2] [3]\n\n\nTokenomic changes [1] 6\n\n\nGrant committee decision with sufficient conflict of interest (eg. cannot achieve majority vote) [1] [2] 2\n\n\nExtending budget\n\n\nEmergency vote / “Break glass” scenario (See Appendix A)What does not go to Snapshot?Individual projects funding\n\n\nAdditional guild fundingQuorum & Voting RequirementsQuorum requirements are formalities to achieve sufficient consensus. Culturally, we should thinking beyond quorum. If a proposal reaches quorum and voting requirements, it is your responsibility to capture feedback and dissent in order to achieve better alignment. If someone raises a good point or you gauge sufficient disagreement, go back to the drawing board and incorporate that feedback. @Kouros has a great example with his Gas Reimbursement post. Despite having a nearly 90% in-favor voting, he has opted to redraft 1 his post to incorporate feedback. We are a DAO, we move together. Ape strong together.\nAs such, authors will be expected to have reasonably attempted to incorporate feedback. as part of the passing requirements.Below is a table for quorum, timeline, and voting thresholds. Numbers are a weighted average 4 of the results from the previous post 10.Screenshot 2021-11-17 1644211722×606 83.4 KBEach season, quorum & voting requirements can be updated as part of the Seasonal SpecEducation RequirementsProposals with big asks and governance changes are often complex.

Simple things like framing language are enough to significantly sway votes.\n\n\nVoter fatigue is real. Too many votes is too much noise. This is reflected in Index Coop 2, which has very low participation on many of their snapshots and is reflected in our own snapshots, with a variance of almost 50% of voters at times.This is consistent with what Boardroom, a governance platform, is noticing as well.twitter.com\n  \n\n  \n    \nKevin Nielsen\n@kevinknielsen\n\n\n  Key learning from building @boardroom_info - voting just ratifies and formalizes changes after rough consensus has been already established\n\n90% of the coordination and decision-making happens beforehand, off-chain\n\nAccess to data ≠ transparency, context is the whole ball game\n\n\n\n  3:41 PM - 27 Oct 2021\n\n    \n      \n        \n      \n      19\n    \n\n    \n      \n        \n      \n      1For these reasons, we have a robust proposal process (unlike Sushiswap that has proposal like this 7) and a seasonal spec that embeds much of our decision into one ratified vote.To align with these values, I’d like to introduce a number of different rules and mechanisms that will help us gather community consensus before moving something to snapshot.SCOPE OF WORKProposes a series of changes to governance that, upon soft consensus will be ratified with an on-chain snapshot vote and subsequently included in each Seasonal Spec thereafter, as parameters are likely to change.SPECIFICATIONWhat Goes to Snapshot?Part of the confusion here is understanding what goes to snapshot and what doesn’t. Historically, we’ve sent the Seasonal Spec to snapshot, along with validating project and guild funding. This is the first time we’ve had a purely tokenomic post gain traction and it wasn’t clear to the community that it would go to snapshot.

Culturally, we should thinking beyond quorum. If a proposal reaches quorum and voting requirements, it is your responsibility to capture feedback and dissent in order to achieve better alignment. If someone raises a good point or you gauge sufficient disagreement, go back to the drawing board and incorporate that feedback. @Kouros has a great example with his Gas Reimbursement post. Despite having a nearly 90% in-favor voting, he has opted to redraft 1 his post to incorporate feedback. We are a DAO, we move together.

{"prompt":"Given previous sections and a summary continue to write the next section\nSummary:\nConsenSys is seeking the opportunity to onboard some of their employees to the Bankless DAO in order to help the DAO across various guilds and projects, allowing their employees to learn how to effectively explore DAO culture, experiment with external contribution in the DAO community and continuously provide value to the wider Ethereum ecosystem.As part of this DAOlationship proposal, ConsenSys would like to secure 50 Guest Passes for a 3 month period so that ConsenSys employees can have a trial period to experience the Bankless DAO prior to independently joining the Bankless DAO (i.e. purchasing 35,000 BANK tokens on their own) and potentially contributing if they should choose to do so.In addition, Bankless DAO will offer additional stewardship, educational materials and support to an agreed upon capacity and ConsenSys will allocate an equal value to this partnership.At ConsenSys, we encourage all employees to dedicate at least one full day every month to third party initiatives external to ConsenSys—namely, DAOs.

Why is this important? well I think in order to accurately asses a project for the benefit of the DAO one must play in the different areas of the organization to understand a holistic perspective of this machine we call Bankless DAO but most importantly the efforts of it’s members.My priorities as a grants committee member, if selected will be looking at the followingProjects that can sustain themselves and bring back revenue to our treasury\nProjects that can assist with our brand awareness and potential conversion of casual members to core members\nProjects that have a product market fit that can assist in the valuation of not only our brand but our token.That’s my priorities - however I think we need to reduce the subjectivity of grant decisions but also allow opportunities for more people to be successful when they submit a proposal. I would also like to spearhead selection criteria for transparent and equitable selection (the same as standard grants do outside of web 3) - with a clear focus on impact, feasibility, costs, measurement criteria and how it relates to the members specified goals in this election (like mine stated above). It reduces the subjectivity and I think having alignment as a committee to what our goals are or providing a clearer measurement tool will allow for a more standardized and equitable decision process.I also think that it would be very helpful to be specific as to what is missing from candidates application in order for them to be successful (again that is why if we had clear goals even as individual assessors we can refer back to it)QualificationsI am very aware of the projects and work of guilds in the Bankless ecosystem\nI personally onboard people to BDAO based on their skill set to specific projects\nI have run grant projects and applied for traditional grants\nFrequently attend GC meetings to listen in\nA DAO governance engineer and DAO governance educator whose goal is to create processes and designs for those intended to participate to do so\nIncredibly pragmatic but will provide helpful feedback\nAlways there to help a member in need aSponsor(s)\njengajojo.eth, Icedcool🏴#4947,puncar#6764,HiroKennellyᵍᵐ🏴#0001,montgomery\n#8177,infinitehomie.eth #4930\n"}

And, if we want to reinforce the market model we are seeing form with Guilds, BANK has to be considered money.So how do we get there? Well, we start by continuing to use BANK for internal commerce100 BANK for a translated newsletter.\n100 BANK to edit my blog post\n500 BANK to design a podcast thumbnail imageAt this stage, BANK is still valueless. No one will sell the BANK they’ve earned, because all of us believe it has future value. To anyone outside of BanklessDAO, we may as well be using 100 trillion Zimbabwe dollar notes.As we progress along seasons, we’ll start to inject value along the way. We’ll introduce membership perks, seasonal subscription perks, dividend payouts, etc. And once we’ve created the infrastructure that will continually increase demand for BANK, then we can say, BANK is Money.\n"}

I highlighted this distinction in Onwards to Season 3! under the Season 3: Revenge of Moloch heading, so I’ll just quickly summarize here:As organizations grow and scale, their underlying operational model must change too. As new organizational behavior and information arise, systems must adapt and modify. Our current operational model - grants, guilds, projects, proposals, compensation - was largely ideated between May 4th and June 8th.Six months in, we’re seeing where the existing operational model is insufficient:In Season 2, the Grants Committee ran out of funding with a month left in the Season, despite increasing the budget by an additional 40% from Season 1\nProjects have come back for funding without a clear way to evaluate whether these projects should be funded a second or third time.\nCommunity voting does not reflect critical evaluation. We largely vote yes without taking the time to evaluate the full scope of a proposal.\n(Related to above) People do not have the bandwidth to participate in proposal discussion\nGrants Committee sometimes does not have sufficient subject matter expertise to evaluate project scope (namely developer projects)\nWe have no way to evaluate the value that a project brings do the DAO when coming back for funding\nCompensation was set at 1000 BANK/hr, back when BANK average 5 cents per token. Today, we sit at 15.\nCompensation varies heavily in the DAO between standard roles like Talent Scout, Guild Coordinator, Secretary, etc.\nL2 contributor status doesn’t accommodate for Guest Pass members that have shown themselves worthy of L2 status.The points above reflect challenges that come from outgrowing our current framework. Not to mention the new challenges unforeseen:SubDAOs\nToken utility within the ecosystem (eg. Driving utility to BANK token, like using it to make purchases or gating content behind a token threshold via Mintgate 3)As a quick aside, I see the problems broken down into two main categories:\n\n\nContributor Retention - How do we properly reward active DAO contributors, accounting for the varying skillsets and time commitment people are making?\n\nStrategic Prioritization - How do we, as a DAO, learn how to say no?My point here is that, in Season 0, we directed our attention in working on the organization and building systems/processes. In Season 1 and Season 2, all those same people worked in the organization. Now, we have new information and behavior that are forcing us to re-evaluate those systems/processes that we built.Now you may stop and say, “Well okay, why don’t we just spin up a working group in this…?

As new organizational behavior and information arise, systems must adapt and modify. Our current operational model - grants, guilds, projects, proposals, compensation - was largely ideated between May 4th and June 8th.Six months in, we’re seeing where the existing operational model is insufficient:In Season 2, the Grants Committee ran out of funding with a month left in the Season, despite increasing the budget by an additional 40% from Season 1\nProjects have come back for funding without a clear way to evaluate whether these projects should be funded a second or third time.\nCommunity voting does not reflect critical evaluation. We largely vote yes without taking the time to evaluate the full scope of a proposal.\n(Related to above) People do not have the bandwidth to participate in proposal discussion\nGrants Committee sometimes does not have sufficient subject matter expertise to evaluate project scope (namely developer projects)\nWe have no way to evaluate the value that a project brings do the DAO when coming back for funding\nCompensation was set at 1000 BANK/hr, back when BANK average 5 cents per token. Today, we sit at 15.\nCompensation varies heavily in the DAO between standard roles like Talent Scout, Guild Coordinator, Secretary, etc.\nL2 contributor status doesn’t accommodate for Guest Pass members that have shown themselves worthy of L2 status.The points above reflect challenges that come from outgrowing our current framework. Not to mention the new challenges unforeseen:SubDAOs\nToken utility within the ecosystem (eg. Driving utility to BANK token, like using it to make purchases or gating content behind a token threshold via Mintgate 3)As a quick aside, I see the problems broken down into two main categories:\n\n\nContributor Retention - How do we properly reward active DAO contributors, accounting for the varying skillsets and time commitment people are making?\n\nStrategic Prioritization - How do we, as a DAO, learn how to say no?My point here is that, in Season 0, we directed our attention in working on the organization and building systems/processes. In Season 1 and Season 2, all those same people worked in the organization. Now, we have new information and behavior that are forcing us to re-evaluate those systems/processes that we built.Now you may stop and say, “Well okay, why don’t we just spin up a working group in this…? Let’s just find a bunch of people interested in solving these problems and let’s get on with it!” Good question! I tried.

In it, I called for a group of interested parties to help scope out our inadequate compensation guidance. The result?

Without an explicit mandate from the DAO saying “This is important, we need people on this project,” it’s really difficult to activate people to redirect their resources and attention on this matter.\nI did not have the time and bandwidth to lead this working group.

They are to work with the DAO to find the optimal solution by progressively designing solutions, presenting them to the DAO, capturing feedback, and iterating.One method of working with the DAO is to create a working group around these two problem spaces. As such, Gov SEs will have to work publicly in these working group. Part of their responsibility will be coordinating these working groups, somewhere between a Guild Coordinator and Project Manager.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" Elections\nFor this initial run of an explicitly tasked and incentivized working group, I want to propose three Gov SEs for these two problem spaces.

Since launch, bDAO has become a flourishing community with 15,000 Discord members and 4,525 token holders, catalyzing a number of promising initiatives ranging from content generation (the Rug, Decentralized Law, State of the DAOs), education (Bankless Academy), consulting (Bankless Consulting), engineering and development work (Degen, Bounty Board), community NFT and merch sales, and new financial products such as BED and GMI in collaboration with IndexCoop. Its native token is BANK.The BANK token has been operating on ETH mainnet since its inception. Given the high liquidity, security, stability and decentralisation benefits of ETH mainnet, this will continue to be the case. However, high gas prices, an end of the gas subsidy agreement with parcel.money in June 2022, the desire to increase tradability of BANK as well as making it more accessible to its members make it necessary to explore additional options.To this end, bDAO treasury established the L2 working group to prepare and enable migration of BANK tokens to different networks, in line with the long term plan for BANK to be multichain.On February 2022 a bDAO successfully voted on a treasury proposal 2 making Polygon the first network to migrate to.This process serves as a role model for other future networks to be adopted, following a bDAO wide poll.The migration to Polygon will affect the payment streams of bDAO treasury as well as those of the individual guilds and applications.Given that the Polygon infrastructure will be set up across bDAO, the respective wallets will require gas in MATIC, the Polygon native token, to execute transactions.The aim is for treasury to source the necessary MATIC centrally for it to be distributed to the entitled wallets, thereby taking advantage of sources within bDAO and externally.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" Budgetary Specifications\nThe treasury will source gas tokens in two steps:Initial phase: at the discretion of the treasury up to 500 USD worth of BANK tokens will be exchanged for MATIC, and other tokens for gas purposes in future, as required.\n\n\nFollowing phases: regular purchase of MATIC, and other tokens for gas purposes in future, based on feedback from guilds and other entities referencing past utility and estimating future demand.\n\n\nCalculation basis for the MATIC swap and other future gas tokens:\n\n\nInitial purchase: the equivalent of up to 500 USD worth, at the discretion of the treasury.

This, in my opinion, boils down to two flaws in V1V1 assumes that GC members have the necessary qualifications to objectively decide which teams and projects are worth funding, however, the reality is that popularity contests seldom result in a panel of experts.\n\n\nProject teams have high passion, but often lack the right support structure or skills in order to succeed.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" GSE Recommendations\nThe GSE took steps in the previous seasons to look at some of these challenges and recommend a few solutions.

Acknowledging that technically the DAO owns all projects, we wanted to facilitate the conversation in being more explicit to support clear decision making going forward.As BanklessDAO projects are moving towards maturity, the decisions around how to structure their revenue, funding and overall governance becomes increasingly important. These structures are relevant as they define the financial impact back to the DAO, and who can make decisions around that. As some projects consider taking outside funding, how they should do that becomes pertinent. Ultimately this question is about, should projects distribute their own tokens for investing, encourage investing to the DAO with funds earmarked in some way for the project, a combination of the above, or something completely different.This post is certainly not exhaustive, but we wanted to at least present some different options and ideas.

{"prompt":"Given previous sections continue to write the next section\nAPPENDIX\n\n\n###\n\n","completion":" A1 - Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)\nWhat happens to the Badges when a member's wallet keys are compromised? Does the issuer simply issue a new Badge?\nCurrently, the issuer would issue a new Badge to a new account in the case of compromise, but Otterspace is working on a reassignment process based on social validation. The original badge can be burned by the holder or revoked by the DAO. Both burning and revocation make the Badge unusable in Collab.Land.Isn’t anyone who has their finger on the issuance a vector for centralization?\nThe issuer is the bDAO community, and it’s up to the community to decide who can act on its behalf. Currently, you can use a Safe multi-sig wallet to act as the issuer if you want to prevent centralization.\nTo address the balance between centralization and convenience, we are working on a system whereby the DAO can decentralize by distributing specific permissions to Badge holders. For example, you could decide that any holder of the Team Lead Badge can act as the issuer for a Guest Pass Badge. These settings will be entirely configurable by the DAO, which allows you to choose your level of decentralization.\nUltimately it is up to the community to decide what functions of the Badges protocol they want to decentralize and to what degree. For Season 6 Ops-guild will have an Optimism Safe w/ 1/X policy to make it easy to quickly respond to updates during this Pilot.  There’s always going to be a trade-off between convenience and decentralization and it’s up to the community to decide where to land on the spectrum. Otterspace’s goal is to provide the tools to go fully decentralized or to be more centralized for the sake of efficiency.Aren’t there risks since it’s a non-transferable Badge?\nBadges are based on the EIP-4973 1 token standard. Otterspace specifically designed the specification so that claimants have as much control as possible. EIP-4973 implements consensual minting, meaning before any token reaches a wallet, a users signature (and therefore consent) is required. And even after receiving it, a user can always perform a full dissociation by burning the token at any time. Further, the Otterspace protocol includes functionalities such as expiry and revocation to enhance usability and address risk concerns.Are Badges in conflict with pseudonymity?\nIt’s important to mention that Badges are in no way tied to personal identity but to users wallets, for which one doesn’t have to reveal their identity. Badge metadata is generic to all holders of the badge, it isn’t unique to the account holding it. I.e. there is no space for individual metadata that could be used to identify someone. (e.g. It does not associate users to their Discord handle).

{"prompt":"Given previous sections continue to write the next section\nA1 - Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)\nWhat happens to the Badges when a member's wallet keys are compromised? Does the issuer simply issue a new Badge?\nCurrently, the issuer would issue a new Badge to a new account in the case of compromise, but Otterspace is working on a reassignment process based on social validation. The original badge can be burned by the holder or revoked by the DAO. Both burning and revocation make the Badge unusable in Collab.Land.Isn’t anyone who has their finger on the issuance a vector for centralization?\nThe issuer is the bDAO community, and it’s up to the community to decide who can act on its behalf. Currently, you can use a Safe multi-sig wallet to act as the issuer if you want to prevent centralization.\nTo address the balance between centralization and convenience, we are working on a system whereby the DAO can decentralize by distributing specific permissions to Badge holders. For example, you could decide that any holder of the Team Lead Badge can act as the issuer for a Guest Pass Badge. These settings will be entirely configurable by the DAO, which allows you to choose your level of decentralization.\nUltimately it is up to the community to decide what functions of the Badges protocol they want to decentralize and to what degree. For Season 6 Ops-guild will have an Optimism Safe w/ 1/X policy to make it easy to quickly respond to updates during this Pilot.  There’s always going to be a trade-off between convenience and decentralization and it’s up to the community to decide where to land on the spectrum. Otterspace’s goal is to provide the tools to go fully decentralized or to be more centralized for the sake of efficiency.Aren’t there risks since it’s a non-transferable Badge?\nBadges are based on the EIP-4973 1 token standard. Otterspace specifically designed the specification so that claimants have as much control as possible. EIP-4973 implements consensual minting, meaning before any token reaches a wallet, a users signature (and therefore consent) is required. And even after receiving it, a user can always perform a full dissociation by burning the token at any time. Further, the Otterspace protocol includes functionalities such as expiry and revocation to enhance usability and address risk concerns.Are Badges in conflict with pseudonymity?\nIt’s important to mention that Badges are in no way tied to personal identity but to users wallets, for which one doesn’t have to reveal their identity. Badge metadata is generic to all holders of the badge, it isn’t unique to the account holding it. I.e. there is no space for individual metadata that could be used to identify someone. (e.g. It does not associate users to their Discord handle). The account address is the identifier users are connected with and nothing else.\nAdditionally, Badges are consented – i.e. they need to be claimed by the holder via signature. This prevents malicious doxxing via airdrop. Issuers cannot send you the Badge, users are just added to the allow-list and may choose to mint or not.\nAfter the season is completed and the Badge has expired (i.e. primary utility is no longer there) the user can choose to burn the Badge if they wish (or keep it as verifiable proof of participation aka. secondary utility). It is 100% up to the wallet owner.More FAQs are answered in the Otterspace Docs 1.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" A2 - Otterspace Minting Guide\nBadge Claim Process (expand for details & screenshots)\nOn the Badge page, click “Sign In” on the top right and sign in with the wallet that you have specified for Season 6.\n\n1600×741 55.5 KB\n\nConnect your wallet to Otterspace.

Does the issuer simply issue a new Badge?\nCurrently, the issuer would issue a new Badge to a new account in the case of compromise, but Otterspace is working on a reassignment process based on social validation. The original badge can be burned by the holder or revoked by the DAO. Both burning and revocation make the Badge unusable in Collab.Land.Isn’t anyone who has their finger on the issuance a vector for centralization?\nThe issuer is the bDAO community, and it’s up to the community to decide who can act on its behalf. Currently, you can use a Safe multi-sig wallet to act as the issuer if you want to prevent centralization.\nTo address the balance between centralization and convenience, we are working on a system whereby the DAO can decentralize by distributing specific permissions to Badge holders. For example, you could decide that any holder of the Team Lead Badge can act as the issuer for a Guest Pass Badge. These settings will be entirely configurable by the DAO, which allows you to choose your level of decentralization.\nUltimately it is up to the community to decide what functions of the Badges protocol they want to decentralize and to what degree. For Season 6 Ops-guild will have an Optimism Safe w/ 1/X policy to make it easy to quickly respond to updates during this Pilot.  There’s always going to be a trade-off between convenience and decentralization and it’s up to the community to decide where to land on the spectrum. Otterspace’s goal is to provide the tools to go fully decentralized or to be more centralized for the sake of efficiency.Aren’t there risks since it’s a non-transferable Badge?\nBadges are based on the EIP-4973 1 token standard. Otterspace specifically designed the specification so that claimants have as much control as possible. EIP-4973 implements consensual minting, meaning before any token reaches a wallet, a users signature (and therefore consent) is required. And even after receiving it, a user can always perform a full dissociation by burning the token at any time. Further, the Otterspace protocol includes functionalities such as expiry and revocation to enhance usability and address risk concerns.Are Badges in conflict with pseudonymity?\nIt’s important to mention that Badges are in no way tied to personal identity but to users wallets, for which one doesn’t have to reveal their identity. Badge metadata is generic to all holders of the badge, it isn’t unique to the account holding it. I.e. there is no space for individual metadata that could be used to identify someone. (e.g. It does not associate users to their Discord handle). The account address is the identifier users are connected with and nothing else.\nAdditionally, Badges are consented – i.e. they need to be claimed by the holder via signature. This prevents malicious doxxing via airdrop. Issuers cannot send you the Badge, users are just added to the allow-list and may choose to mint or not.\nAfter the season is completed and the Badge has expired (i.e. primary utility is no longer there) the user can choose to burn the Badge if they wish (or keep it as verifiable proof of participation aka. secondary utility). It is 100% up to the wallet owner.More FAQs are answered in the Otterspace Docs 1.\n"}

The Participant Badges will expire automatically at the end of Season 6, and process will start over again in Season 7 (if sentiment of this experiment is positive).These Badges will be used in Collab.Land gating logic for server access control to improve security holes that exist as contributors go inactive or go below 35k BANK. Expired Badges can no longer be used for access via Collab.Land in subsequent seasons, but they can be retained by contributors as proof of their presence and participation at the start of Season 6 (or simply burned if they no longer wish to hold them).Quick Example:@level2 discord role access will require that the member hold:A Level 2 Otterspace Badge AND\n\nAn unexpired Season Participant Badge AND\n\nMaintain the 35K BANK threshold of an @level1.This will ensure that as L2s go inactive or dump BANK their @level2 access will lapse until they renew their Participation Badge and/or regain the 35K BANK. This also brings the added benefit of no longer relying on Discord role-tags as the ‘source of truth’ for this important L2 status.\n1600×741 130 KB\nAfter you’ve signed in, you click on “mint Badge” in the center of the screen. bDAO members do not have to pay for minting fees. As part of the implementation, Otterspace sends every user $1 of ETH on Optimism, which will cover minting fees for 4-8 Badges. The process will be seamless and no additional setup is needed, you only have to sign the transaction.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" 1600×741 67.7 KB\nAfter successful minting, members can view their Badge in the user profile and use the Badge for gating in various downstream integrations, such as Collab.Land.1600×741 67.4 KB\n"}

If this is considered valuable, we suggest doing a seasonal temp check of the DAO sentiment.Example:Vote 1, top 3 results: Guilds should be talent pools, Media Focus, Revenue generation.Vote 2 options (drilling down on Revenue generation), “How can we change our funding requirement to incentivize projects generating revenue for the DAO?”The result will help all involved in governance of the DAO with a sentiment check where the contributor base feels their focus should be, it will (hopefully) be apparent where we’re currently lacking clarity and/or focus. We feel that the DAO has chosen centralization of sentiment gauging to core contributors who make proposals based on their view of sentiment and DAO priorities within governance. This would enable the masses to set the priorities for the working groups, without interference or scoping in terms of options.For the voting weight we suggest a simple allocation of 100 tokens per BANK holder, making no difference between someone holding 1mBANK or 100 BANK. We’re looking for wide sentiment and not to pass a snapshot proposal. Whenever we as a DAO can make everyone’s voices heard we most definitely should aim to take the chance.

Using this first contest the DAO and the DAO Governance can continue drilling down within the areas of its members using the jokedao tool. If this is considered valuable, we suggest doing a seasonal temp check of the DAO sentiment.Example:Vote 1, top 3 results: Guilds should be talent pools, Media Focus, Revenue generation.Vote 2 options (drilling down on Revenue generation), “How can we change our funding requirement to incentivize projects generating revenue for the DAO?”The result will help all involved in governance of the DAO with a sentiment check where the contributor base feels their focus should be, it will (hopefully) be apparent where we’re currently lacking clarity and/or focus.

The List of DAOs is already established with over 200+ DAOs listed, so no development cost is needed as the product is in place. A submission document will be created and placed in the DAOlationships channel that can be used to submit a DAO to be added to the directory. Upon form submission by a Bankless DAO member, the DAO will be vetted by the List of DAOs team to ensure it has members, is functioning as a DAO, has proper links, etc. Once approved, the DAO will be added, and the member who submitted it will be given a small amount of BANK Token (5-25). Likewise, members can earn BANK token by submitting a DAO to be archived and updated. This could be because a DAO has met it mission or is no longer active.**Bank Token\nThis proposal requests 35,000 Bank tokens, the current cost of one membership, to start. 35,000/25 (BANK given to each submission) is around 1400 DAOs that can be listed. We list about a DAO a day on the List of DAOs, so this project has a span of approximately 4 years, or 1400/365. Members can submit multiple DAOs to be approved or archived but all submissions must be vetted.**Benefits of collab to the Bankless DAO- The proposed benefits of this collab are:The BANK tokens go directly back to the members.\nCollab creates a living DAO Directory that focuses efforts with List of DAOs.

I think subDAO is a misnomer and can be easily misinterpreted to mean different things. My quick two gwei here is that a subDAO is just a DAO within a DAO. Any node (core or ecosystem) should strive to be a subDAO (in that they adopt the DAO model and infrastructure) but is not necessary.For example, Fight Club will need to incorporate for legal reasons, meaning they cannot be a DAO by definition. They can certainly operate with the values of a DAO, but have off-chain structured hierarches in the form of an LLC.On the other hands, Guilds can easily turn structure themselves as DAOs and go on-chain.

I am 0xZFi, and I helped coordinate the Season 6 transition just a few short months ago. The processes around season transitions have been adapting to changes in governance, so I’d like to offer some context on the current state of the season transition process.As I understood the process before the Season 6 transition, the Community Vote was a temp-check process of aggregated votes, and was to inform what would be collectively included in the Seasonal Specification. The Seasonal Specification included all changes, in all areas, into one packaged vote – funding requests from all groups, governance changes, operational changes, and the detailed seasonal timeline.It was brought to attention late last season that the Community Vote/Seasonal Specification process, with the scope that had been used for several previous seasons, was superseded by the Constitution 3 upon its ratification. To bring the season transition process into alignment with the Constitution for Season 6, it meant we needed to split the process flows of the old Community Vote into separate workstreams.Any portion of the old Seasonal Specification that requested funding would need to go through the Seasonal Budget Request\nAny changes to governance would need to be proposed with their own individual bDIPsThere is unclear guidance, however, on operational changes that do not impact the Constitution. Without this guidance, that leaves the scope of the Seasonal Specification limited to operational timelines and a list of references to operational changes that have passed individually on the Forum throughout the current season.Given these changes, the Community Vote process that was used through Season 5 does not seem to fit anymore. I would encourage any ideas that you’d like to temp-check or operational adjustments you’d like to propose to be posted individually to the Forum at any point during the season.This change empowers all members to participate in governance without relying on the Operations Department to aggregate and curate topics to be discussed. It also affords the Operations Department an opportunity to reduce the overhead cost of the season transition process so BANK funds can be used more effectively elsewhere.This process is evolving and is not without flaws. Suggestions for improvements are welcome. Thank you for your active participation in BanklessDAO governance. Let’s make 2023 up-only!\n\n###\n\n","completion":" Remaining Season 6 Operations Timeline\nGantt Chart [Season 6 Timeline - Google Sheets 2]January 3: Draft 1 of the Season 7 Specification posted to the Forum\nJanuary 9 - 19: The Grants Committee will accept applications for Season 7 Committee Member elections\nJanuary 17: Draft 2 of the Season 7 Specification to be posted to the Forum, if needed\nJanuary 20: The Season 7 Grants Committee election will be posted to Snapshot\nJanuary 20: All funding requests from guilds, departments, and projects to be posted to the Forum for the Grants Committee to review\nJanuary 20 - January 29: The Grants Committee will work with groups to review and finalize their budgets\nJanuary 30: The Season 7 Specification will be posted to Snapshot\nJanuary 30: The Season 7 Budget Request will be posted to Snapshot\nJanuary 30 - February 5: Gap Week\nFebruary 5: Last day of Season 6\n"}

{"prompt":"Given previous sections continue to write the next section\nGuilds As Professional Associations: a new funding model\nOur DAO currently views guilds as talent pools that must be funded through the Grants Committee. However, the DAO will quickly run the treasury dry if we fund guilds without question. So, we need a better way to look at guild funding. This will allow the Grants Committee to put more bandwidth toward identifying how to fund projects rather than stressing over Guild funding.I spoke with a number of guild coordinators to get feedback on membership numbers and pain points. Here are a few commonalities:Membership numbers are very difficult to measure, but they’re much lower than the number of people holding the tag, the people listed on the guild’s notion page, or the people in the Sobol bubble.\nMembership retention is really tough: people come and go, whether it’s because they think they can make more crypto elsewhere, our meetings don’t fit their timezone, or the vibes aren’t what they’re looking for—there’s a lot of “permissionless leaving.”\nThe gray area between guilds and projects is difficult to define. Many guilds run projects underneath them, while others are more true to the original talent pool ethos.Thank you to all the guild coordinators who answered my questions.

They were very good to our team, providing free entry, media passes and everything we needed to shoot on site. The team is clearly passionate about the topics covered and I believe that joining their network to continue our relationship in any way is a strong move for the DAO and the potential of the space.What I would like to hear conversation around is how the benefits might apply to us, beyond discounts on individual membership. My thoughts are as follows:Exposure within the DoinGud ecosystem, alongside the other notable participants, would give us marketing boost.\nEvent sponsorship discounts would be excellent if we were further along in our DAO journey and had a stronger winter treasury. Both BanklessDAO and Bankless Academy were invited to sponsor ETHBarcelona, but without the funds to back up their interest. After seeing the exposure that sponsors received, it is definitely an attractive offer for a later date (and maybe not this membership cycle).\nThe “Gud Souls” NFT whitelist/discount is attractive add to the value of holding $BANK, but only in the early days before public mint.I have included a poll to gauge sentiment and decide, if we’re interested in applying, what membership tier we should consider. Personally, I think that getting involved with at least a Tier 3 membership (1.1 ETH for 1 year) is a good move for the DAO, securing us 5 DAO governance seats and keeping us involved in the DoinGud ecosystem.

More info here. 10 Should BanklessDAO become a DoinGud partner, BanklessDAO members would gain an 11%-33% discount based on tier selected.Beyond membership access to the DAO, each “Gud Soul” NFT holder, depending on the tier, will get a bundle of benefits ranging from exclusive access to the beta tools and sales modes, special collaborations with our partners’ list, and bonus rewards for using the platform.DoinGud is releasing these “Gud Soul” NFTs in two stages:Private allow list, including BanklessDAO.\nPublic sale.The proceeds of the “Gud Soul” Membership NFT Sales will go towards:Funding the building of the DoinGud protocol and marketplace.\nDonations to the social causes and Impact DAOs that join them as community partners.In the future, the proceeds will also go to help bootstrap the impact guilds and communities using the protocol.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" Application Timeline\nIn order to proceed with the DoinGud DAO Community Membership, the steps include:Inform of the election of Membership Tier (first come/first served) by September 13th.\nSign Agreement (will be prepared based on membership tier elected in step 1) by September 16th.\nSend funds (Wallet address provided in the agreement in step 2) by September 16th.\nSend members Ethereum wallet addresses for the Private Allow List by September 16th.\nSend the Ethereum wallet addresses of representatives that will be given seats into the DoinGud DAO by September 16th.\nElect Community Membership Tier (supply limited, first come/first served).\n"}
{"prompt":"Given previous sections and a summary continue to write the next section\nSummary:\nDoinGud 12, the team behind ETHBarcelona 5, is an NFT marketplace operating on Polygon that offers the unique function of routing a certain percentage of sales towards a cause of the NFT creator’s choice.In launching their DAO, they have invited BanklessDAO to join them as a community partner. They are looking for value-aligned communities to build, educate, and advance the web3 public goods movement.In the partnership, they are looking to share value with BanklessDAO through:A dedicated number of seats in DoinGud DAO governance.\nCollaboration on future events (including priority sponsorship tiers at a discount).\nAmplified exposure as a community for good (recognition on website and social media).\nA sizable discount and allow-list access to the DoinGud membership NFT sale upcoming for all BanklessDAO L1+ members.As a community member of the DoinGud DAO, we would be joining Developer DAO, Livepeer, Gitcoin, BrightID, Kleros, Proof-of-humanity, Kernel, Giveth, TheDAOist and more, in a statement support for the #regen movement.\nApplication Timeline\nIn order to proceed with the DoinGud DAO Community Membership, the steps include:Inform of the election of Membership Tier (first come/first served) by September 13th.\nSign Agreement (will be prepared based on membership tier elected in step 1) by September 16th.\nSend funds (Wallet address provided in the agreement in step 2) by September 16th.\nSend members Ethereum wallet addresses for the Private Allow List by September 16th.\nSend the Ethereum wallet addresses of representatives that will be given seats into the DoinGud DAO by September 16th.\nElect Community Membership Tier (supply limited, first come/first served).\n\n###\n\n","completion":" Tetra-note\nPersonally, after visiting ETHBarcelona I am pretty bullish on the DoinGud team. They were very good to our team, providing free entry, media passes and everything we needed to shoot on site. The team is clearly passionate about the topics covered and I believe that joining their network to continue our relationship in any way is a strong move for the DAO and the potential of the space.What I would like to hear conversation around is how the benefits might apply to us, beyond discounts on individual membership. My thoughts are as follows:Exposure within the DoinGud ecosystem, alongside the other notable participants, would give us marketing boost.\nEvent sponsorship discounts would be excellent if we were further along in our DAO journey and had a stronger winter treasury. Both BanklessDAO and Bankless Academy were invited to sponsor ETHBarcelona, but without the funds to back up their interest. After seeing the exposure that sponsors received, it is definitely an attractive offer for a later date (and maybe not this membership cycle).\nThe “Gud Souls” NFT whitelist/discount is attractive add to the value of holding $BANK, but only in the early days before public mint.I have included a poll to gauge sentiment and decide, if we’re interested in applying, what membership tier we should consider. Personally, I think that getting involved with at least a Tier 3 membership (1.1 ETH for 1 year) is a good move for the DAO, securing us 5 DAO governance seats and keeping us involved in the DoinGud ecosystem.

Our original S1 spec 1 is astoundingly detailed and has decentralized decision making baked in:unnamed1386×712 23.7 KBIn S1, we adopted a more centralized approach. In S2, we progressively decentralized, and we will continue to do so with time.CoordinationOur fundamental coordination layer are our guilds 1. In S0, guilds were prototypical. In S1, we saw them flourish. When people join the DAO, they go to the guilds first. Guilds are largely responsible for staffing projects and capturing talent that comes into the DAO.They hold weekly meetings. Segment Discord channels by activities. Have elected positions, both generalized and guild specific 2. There’s even discussion about cross-guild roles, like the Creative Council.Dev guild took a major step by creating their own newsletter 4 and the Writers Guild has earned revenue through external client work.Project Workflow720×780 11.2 KBProject ManagementProjects are how we move towards our Mission 3. But I believe we’re still learning how to manage projects. Recently, I wrote a post on how projects should be scoped, staffed, and executed:Project Proposal Framework General\n  \n  \n    Introduction\nGuilds and projects are two core components of how BanklessDAO operates. Over the past three months, we’ve made steady steps towards formalizing guilds. The most recent step-level improvement has been the creation of roles within each guild. \nWhile tremendous progress has been made in guilds, guidance on projects has fallen behind. People are confused about when to write a proposal, how to get feedback, what to include, and a number of other important details that go unnoticed. Thi…In S2, this workflow will be formalized as part of the S2 Spec. But for now, project management is a bit weak. There are some exceptions that have excellent project managers, but projects are often understaffed, specifications are weak, and updates are captured disparately on community calls and meeting notes. It’s difficult to get a concise view of what’s happening at the DAO.We do have a projects dashboard 1 that I created some months back that has been sporadically updated, but hasn’t been curated and managed. This season, the Ops Guild will make this a focus – or at least I will.Onboarding@Behold and @angyts have done a fantastic job with First Quest. First Quest is our onboarding procedure.So far, we’ve seen an explosion in Guest Passes and members responding in #get-involved (shoutout to Viking and Grendel for constantly responding to members) and a sustained spike in our newsletter subscription, as per the instructions in #first-quest:Screenshot 2021-09-15 194605867×661 27.4 KBTheir S2 proposal 2 goes beyond the MVP stage and is even more ambitious. By the end of S2, we’ll have a scalable way to get people directly involved with where they are interested, such as guild specific first quests, talent scouts, and regular onboarding webinars.CompensationThe biggest question mark is compensation. This is a big focus on S2, as I suggested in the Onwards to Season 2 post.In order for us to retain talent, we need to make sure people are properly compensated for the work they’re putting in. We have a number of levers:Hourly pay\nLump sum\nCoordinape\nRevenue share\nKPIs\nFull time employeesI’m working on another large forum post on compensation. For now, let’s assume that by the end of S2, we’ll have a stable idea of how work will be compensated and which levers are appropriate to use when.Together, these 5 spokes create a steady foundation for us to really scale. To really hit the gas pedal, attract talent, staff projects, grow guilds, create new membership perks, and really take this experiment we’re on the next level. If any of these 5 spokes are weak or unstable, we will hit major points of friction that can grind us to a halt.Collins flywheel21244×1051 20.6 KBHitting ScaleI believe that by the end of S2, we’ll have solidified the three remaining flywheel spokes. So what then?

This represents around 15% of our total seasonal budget. This BANK is distributed monthly - 500K BANK respectively for Guest Pass, L1, and L2 contributors.Contributors sign up for the coordinape round monthly and allocate GIVE to their fellow contributors.

{"prompt":"Given previous sections continue to write the next section\nBackground\nCoordinape is the product we use to distribute 4.5M BANK a season for contributor rewards. This represents around 15% of our total seasonal budget. This BANK is distributed monthly - 500K BANK respectively for Guest Pass, L1, and L2 contributors.Contributors sign up for the coordinape round monthly and allocate GIVE to their fellow contributors.

Because of the way GIVE translates to BANK, contributors are incentivized NOT to allocate, because they get a bigger piece of the pie when they don’t.\nOur L2s are our most active contributors, and it’s possible (and probable) that less active Guest Passes receive MORE in coordinape rounds than these extremely active contributors simply because there are more L2s sharing the same 500K BANK. I’ve personally dumped a ton of GIVE on a Guest Pass simply because I didn’t have anyone else to give it to.\n\n\n\nCoordinape doesn’t encourage contributors to move up member levels\n\nIn May’s coordinape allocation 4, the top Guest Pass and L1 each received around 2x more BANK than the top L2. I’ve even seen contributors refuse L2 nominations.\nSince Guest Passes can’t allocate GIVE, it’s desirable for them to stay as Guest Passes to benefit from coordinape without contributing to it.\n"}

To enact high transparency, decisions made by the Representative group and the Grants Committee will be subject to snapshot approval. This ensures a high level of transparency where token holders can also have a direct influence on project funding.\nFunding Philosophy\nWhat is our “North Star” for funding projects?A principled approach to project funding and evaluation requires that our mission, vision and values are clearly stated and that our community is aligned behind this mission. From our Mission, Vision, and Values page:“We will help the world go Bankless by creating user-friendly onramps for people to discover decentralized financial technologies through education, media, and culture.”In my opinion, our funding philosophy should prioritize revenue generation and a strong BANK token. This will lead to a flywheel of projects and set us up to create long-term sustainable impact on the world. I’ve outlined my thoughts on the subject here:BanklessDAO Project Revenue and Ownership Discussion - DRAFT 1 Governance\n  \n  \n    Seeing as how the DAO is not yet sustainable, the most DAO-aligned investment model is most compelling to me. Once we are sustainable we can decentralize our projects. We don’t have to only use one model. We can use them sequentially. \nProject progression would look like this: \n\nDepartment\nSubDAO\nSeparate Entity\n\nWe can either dilly dally our way to being self-sustaining or we can focus on getting there immediately. In the former, BANK will slowly bleed to 0 and we might never become self-sustai…TL;DR - We need a strong BANK token to continue to impact the world and the best way to create a strong BANK token is through revenue generation and a strong treasury.Given these goals: sustainability, strong BANK, and impact. How should we get there? Fundamentally, all things will flow from revenue generation. This is what we should be optimizing for, but how we get there is another question. Clearly, we’re funding projects, but how do we prioritize them?At present, I think about this as a scale between two philosophies: long-term revenue generation and short-term revenue generation.In the long-term case, the DAO will have a high risk tolerance — a tolerance for lack of cash flows and for delayed cash flows. The long-term projects will likely take time to fruit (ex: software products/services) but are set to have strong business models once they do (SaaS, tokens, etc).In the short-term case, we’ll have a lower risk tolerance and we’ll cut projects that do not generate revenue — or lack a concrete plan to do so — and prioritize projects that generate income today. Again, I see these two poles not as an “either/or” but a dichotomy for us to manage through revenue modeling and rigorous project evaluation. In all cases, projects will be held accountable for the milestones they promise.My thoughts on our goals are ordered here:Be cash flow positive - This means on-chain revenue, clearly stated KPIs and set deliverables that are highly aligned with this goal, and being careful with the money we spend. bDAO is like a nation that must create goods and achieve income; a strong nation should have a strong treasury.\n\n\nBegin incubator phase - Once we have reached “escape velocity” we can begin to fund more ambitious projects. But funded projects have to execute on their promises.Without a clear view of where we are going and what we are trying to accomplish, the path forward towards evaluating and funding projects becomes tenuous at best. Many of the problems we are currently facing are due to a lack of the ability to strategically align behind a clearly stated purpose.In order to create a framework for the strategic prioritization of project evaluation and funding, this post proposes the following Project Evaluation Framework and Optimistic Governance Structure 2.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" Funding Mechanism\n\n"}

As new organizational behavior and information arise, systems must adapt and modify. Our current operational model - grants, guilds, projects, proposals, compensation - was largely ideated between May 4th and June 8th.Six months in, we’re seeing where the existing operational model is insufficient:In Season 2, the Grants Committee ran out of funding with a month left in the Season, despite increasing the budget by an additional 40% from Season 1\nProjects have come back for funding without a clear way to evaluate whether these projects should be funded a second or third time.\nCommunity voting does not reflect critical evaluation. We largely vote yes without taking the time to evaluate the full scope of a proposal.\n(Related to above) People do not have the bandwidth to participate in proposal discussion\nGrants Committee sometimes does not have sufficient subject matter expertise to evaluate project scope (namely developer projects)\nWe have no way to evaluate the value that a project brings do the DAO when coming back for funding\nCompensation was set at 1000 BANK/hr, back when BANK average 5 cents per token. Today, we sit at 15.\nCompensation varies heavily in the DAO between standard roles like Talent Scout, Guild Coordinator, Secretary, etc.\n\n Grants Committee standardized Guild Coordinapes at 75,000\nL2 contributor status doesn’t accommodate for Guest Pass members that have shown themselves worthy of L2 status.The points above reflect challenges that come from outgrowing our current framework. Not to mention the new challenges unforeseen:SubDAOs\nToken utility within the ecosystem (eg. Driving utility to BANK token, like using it to make purchases or gating content behind a token threshold via Mintgate  2)As a quick aside, I see the problems broken down into two main categories:\n\n\nContributor Alignment - How do we properly reward active DAO contributors, accounting for the varying skillsets and time commitment people are making?\n\nStrategic Prioritization -  What should we say no to? How do we, as a DAO, learn how to say no?  How do we do this in a way that empowers the community to make decisions while also letting high-context individuals influence outcomes?My point here is that, in Season 0, we directed our attention in working on the organization and building systems/processes. In Season 1 and Season 2, all those same people worked in the organization. Now, we have new information and behavior that are forcing us to re-evaluate those systems/processes that we built.Now you may stop and say, “Well okay, why don’t we just spin up a working group in this…? Let’s just find a bunch of people interested in solving these problems and let’s get on with it!” Good question! I tried. Nearly 3 months ago, I created this forum post: ALL HANDS ON DECK: Compensation and PLM Working Groups  2. In it, I called for a group of interested parties to help scope out our inadequate compensation guidance. The result? Despite having 15 people signal their interest  2, we only met three times and we delivered on this flimsy forum post  2.I see this failure resulting from two factors:Our working group did not have explicit signaling from the DAO that this was a major priority. We’re all fucking busy in our respective niches. Without an explicit mandate from the DAO saying “This is important, we need people on this project,” it’s really difficult to activate people to redirect their resources and attention on this matter.\nI did not have the time and bandwidth to lead this working group. I was active in a number of different places in the DAO, and without some social signal and explicitly incentivization, it eventually fell down my priority list.Given my experience here, I want to propose a new model - One that creates an explicit mandate from the DAO to focus on these two problem areas and properly incentivizes participation.Ladies, Gentlemen, and non-binaries, I’d like to introduce the Governance Solutions Engineer Program\n"}

I was active in a number of different places in the DAO, and without some social signal and explicitly incentivization, it eventually fell down my priority list.Given my experience here, I want to propose a new model - One that creates an explicit mandate from the DAO to focus on these two problem areas and properly incentivizes participation.Ladies, Gentlemen, and non-binaries, I’d like to introduce the Governance Solutions Engineer Program\n\n###\n\n","completion":" MISSION & VALUES ALIGNMENT\nI’m going to be lazy here, but in the Onwards to Season 3! forum post, I did a quick temp check on this topic with overwhelming support of a focus on Governance and Coordination:Screenshot 2022-01-04 180620893×445 23.9 KB\n"}

In most DAOs, temp check leads to off-chain snapshot votes and eventually to on-chain voting. As a result, an average person Getting lost in this long process of multiple voting rounds is to be expected. Lower voter turnover and unmet quorums hinder the maturing process of DAO.‘’Governance architects and token holders historically believed in delegating voting power to individuals with competence, discipline, and bandwidth to participate in DAOs.

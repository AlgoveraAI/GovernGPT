This is still the case today.I personally reached out via Discord and Telegram, but have still received no reply.With the looming S6 GC election, it dawned on us that the timing of a potential replacement was ‚Äúideal‚Äù and if Apollo was removed or stepped down, he could be replaced in the same election - preventing a singleton Snapshot election.That kicked off a discussion about the Grants Committee‚Äôs internal ability to dismiss fellow members.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" GC Powers\nCould we dismiss a member?At first, the assumption was that we would need to go to Snapshot to add/remove all members, but upon further inspection the S5 Spec 2 only refers to the limitations for adding members: ‚ÄúThe Committee cannot change the application process to be a Committee member.‚ÄùNotably, the GC is ‚Äúotherwise responsible for their own operations‚Äù.The combination of these two facts led us to consider that, so long as quorum could still be met, the GC could dismiss a member with a unanimous vote (excluding the member in question).\n"}

This was because, historically:Many snapshot voters are not engaged in day-to-day operations in the DAO and will miss a lot of context. Simple things like framing language are enough to significantly sway votes.\n\n\nVoter fatigue is real. Too many votes is too much noise. This is reflected in Index Coop 2, which has very low participation on many of their snapshots and is reflected in our own snapshots, with a variance of almost 50% of voters at times.This is consistent with what Boardroom, a governance platform, is noticing as well.twitter.com\n  \n\n  \n    \nKevin Nielsen\n@kevinknielsen\n\n\n  Key learning from building @boardroom_info - voting just ratifies and formalizes changes after rough consensus has been already established\n\n90% of the coordination and decision-making happens beforehand, off-chain\n\nAccess to data ‚â† transparency, context is the whole ball game\n\n\n\n  3:41 PM - 27 Oct 2021\n\n    \n      \n        \n      \n      19\n    \n\n    \n      \n        \n      \n      1For these reasons, we have a robust proposal process (unlike Sushiswap that has proposal like this 7) and a seasonal spec that embeds much of our decision into one ratified vote.To align with these values, I‚Äôd like to introduce a number of different rules and mechanisms that will help us gather community consensus before moving something to snapshot.SCOPE OF WORKProposes a series of changes to governance that, upon soft consensus will be ratified with an on-chain snapshot vote and subsequently included in each Seasonal Spec thereafter, as parameters are likely to change.SPECIFICATIONWhat Goes to Snapshot?Part of the confusion here is understanding what goes to snapshot and what doesn‚Äôt. Historically, we‚Äôve sent the Seasonal Spec to snapshot, along with validating project and guild funding. This is the first time we‚Äôve had a purely tokenomic post gain traction and it wasn‚Äôt clear to the community that it would go to snapshot. As such, here are few reasons something should go to snapshot. Please comment if you have further suggestions:Seasonal specification (including Grants Committee allocation) [1] 3 [2] 3\n\n\nSeasonal Project and Guild funding [1] 8\n\n\nMajor Governance changes [1] 1 [2] [3]\n\n\nTokenomic changes [1] 6\n\n\nGrant committee decision with sufficient conflict of interest (eg. cannot achieve majority vote) [1] [2] 2\n\n\nExtending budget\n\n\nEmergency vote / ‚ÄúBreak glass‚Äù scenario (See Appendix A)What does not go to Snapshot?Individual projects funding\n\n\nAdditional guild fundingQuorum & Voting RequirementsQuorum requirements are formalities to achieve sufficient consensus. Culturally, we should thinking beyond quorum. If a proposal reaches quorum and voting requirements, it is your responsibility to capture feedback and dissent in order to achieve better alignment.

This was because, historically:Many snapshot voters are not engaged in day-to-day operations in the DAO and will miss a lot of context. Simple things like framing language are enough to significantly sway votes.\n\n\nVoter fatigue is real. Too many votes is too much noise. This is reflected in Index Coop 2, which has very low participation on many of their snapshots and is reflected in our own snapshots, with a variance of almost 50% of voters at times.This is consistent with what Boardroom, a governance platform, is noticing as well.twitter.com\n  \n\n  \n    \nKevin Nielsen\n@kevinknielsen\n\n\n  Key learning from building @boardroom_info - voting just ratifies and formalizes changes after rough consensus has been already established\n\n90% of the coordination and decision-making happens beforehand, off-chain\n\nAccess to data ‚â† transparency, context is the whole ball game\n\n\n\n  3:41 PM - 27 Oct 2021\n\n    \n      \n        \n      \n      19\n    \n\n    \n      \n        \n      \n      1For these reasons, we have a robust proposal process (unlike Sushiswap that has proposal like this 7) and a seasonal spec that embeds much of our decision into one ratified vote.To align with these values, I‚Äôd like to introduce a number of different rules and mechanisms that will help us gather community consensus before moving something to snapshot.SCOPE OF WORKProposes a series of changes to governance that, upon soft consensus will be ratified with an on-chain snapshot vote and subsequently included in each Seasonal Spec thereafter, as parameters are likely to change.SPECIFICATIONWhat Goes to Snapshot?Part of the confusion here is understanding what goes to snapshot and what doesn‚Äôt.

If someone raises a good point or you gauge sufficient disagreement, go back to the drawing board and incorporate that feedback. @Kouros has a great example with his Gas Reimbursement post. Despite having a nearly 90% in-favor voting, he has opted to redraft 1 his post to incorporate feedback. We are a DAO, we move together.

The governance structure requires token holders to vote and pass almost every proposal. For votes to move forward, they have to reach quorum. Reaching a quorum can be challenging since many token holders aren‚Äôt interested in voting. According to DeepDAO, many top DAOs have less than 5% participation.1600√ó796 190 KBsource:  DeepDAO.io 3Do you believe that The DAOs need more engagement?

Another reason for voter apathy is the reasonably complex nature of decentralised governance; there is a lengthy period of discussion which follows a temp check.

I would also like to spearhead selection criteria for transparent and equitable selection (the same as standard grants do outside of web 3) - with a clear focus on impact, feasibility, costs, measurement criteria and how it relates to the members specified goals in this election (like mine stated above).

Well, we start by continuing to use BANK for internal commerce100 BANK for a translated newsletter.\n100 BANK to edit my blog post\n500 BANK to design a podcast thumbnail imageAt this stage, BANK is still valueless. No one will sell the BANK they‚Äôve earned, because all of us believe it has future value. To anyone outside of BanklessDAO, we may as well be using 100 trillion Zimbabwe dollar notes.As we progress along seasons, we‚Äôll start to inject value along the way. We‚Äôll introduce membership perks, seasonal subscription perks, dividend payouts, etc. And once we‚Äôve created the infrastructure that will continually increase demand for BANK, then we can say, BANK is Money.\n"}

This 500,000 BANK would be allocated to the working group and distributed as per the group‚Äôs decision, not at the Gov SE‚Äôs discretion.\nWhat are Gov SEs?\nIn the failures section just above, I pointed out how I did not have the bandwidth to coordinate/lead the Compensation working group. As such, the working group ended up falling to the wayside on my list of priorities.Given this outcome, I think it‚Äôs important to explicitly assign coordinator responsibility. We need people who view it as their #1 priority to lead these working groups. As such, I define Gov SEs as:Governance-minded DAO members elected to spec out a comprehensive solution to mission-critical DAO infrastructure challenges.\nThese members are not to operate in silos and make decisions on behalf of the DAO. They are to work with the DAO to find the optimal solution by progressively designing solutions, presenting them to the DAO, capturing feedback, and iterating.\nGov SEs have appropriate context for the problems they are working on and properly embody the values of the DAO. They are trusted by their social reputation for acting in the best interest in the DAO.\n\nGov SEs must make this their #1 priority. They may hold one other leadership position, but that‚Äôs it.\n\nFor example, I am the Ops Guild Coordinator and (defacto) Writers Guild Governance Coordinator. I would have to step down from one of those positions in order to be a Gov SE.\nThey may participate in lower order activities. Eg, if I wanted to write a piece of the Newsletter, I can do that. But I cannot accept a role on the newsletter team.\nGov SEs cannot be on the Grants Committee (not 100% sure on this‚Ä¶ what do you think?)A successful Gov SE program should result in major clout for Gov SEs in the DAO. At the risk of sounded vain‚Ä¶ what if there were more frogmonkees? Ooh ooh aah aah motherfucker.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" What is the Scope of Work?\nRight now, I think the scope of work should be limited to our most existential threats: (1) Contributor Retention and (2) Strategic Prioritization.

This will give a better experience for new members because they will feel a slight push to explore the value that the DAO can bring to them. Additionally, it will lead to a better experience for current members because there will be a higher bar of commitment for everyone in the DAO.Furthermore, limiting the Guest pass can create speculative demand for BANK due to the nature of having a large gated community.

Badges can be easily designed and issued to members via the Otterspace app interface. Through the API endpoint, members can also be automatically added to an allowlist programmatically. The protocol also supports badge revocation, expiry, and reinstatement, so the community is able to respond to bad actors. The team is also co-authoring a token standard specifically for non-transferable tokens (EIP 4973 1) on top of which they are building an open protocol.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" Pilot Plan Details\n\n"}

Does the issuer simply issue a new Badge?\nCurrently, the issuer would issue a new Badge to a new account in the case of compromise, but Otterspace is working on a reassignment process based on social validation. The original badge can be burned by the holder or revoked by the DAO. Both burning and revocation make the Badge unusable in Collab.Land.Isn‚Äôt anyone who has their finger on the issuance a vector for centralization?\nThe issuer is the bDAO community, and it‚Äôs up to the community to decide who can act on its behalf. Currently, you can use a Safe multi-sig wallet to act as the issuer if you want to prevent centralization.\nTo address the balance between centralization and convenience, we are working on a system whereby the DAO can decentralize by distributing specific permissions to Badge holders. For example, you could decide that any holder of the Team Lead Badge can act as the issuer for a Guest Pass Badge. These settings will be entirely configurable by the DAO, which allows you to choose your level of decentralization.\nUltimately it is up to the community to decide what functions of the Badges protocol they want to decentralize and to what degree. For Season 6 Ops-guild will have an Optimism Safe w/ 1/X policy to make it easy to quickly respond to updates during this Pilot.  There‚Äôs always going to be a trade-off between convenience and decentralization and it‚Äôs up to the community to decide where to land on the spectrum. Otterspace‚Äôs goal is to provide the tools to go fully decentralized or to be more centralized for the sake of efficiency.Aren‚Äôt there risks since it‚Äôs a non-transferable Badge?\nBadges are based on the EIP-4973 1 token standard. Otterspace specifically designed the specification so that claimants have as much control as possible. EIP-4973 implements consensual minting, meaning before any token reaches a wallet, a users signature (and therefore consent) is required. And even after receiving it, a user can always perform a full dissociation by burning the token at any time. Further, the Otterspace protocol includes functionalities such as expiry and revocation to enhance usability and address risk concerns.Are Badges in conflict with pseudonymity?\nIt‚Äôs important to mention that Badges are in no way tied to personal identity but to users wallets, for which one doesn‚Äôt have to reveal their identity. Badge metadata is generic to all holders of the badge, it isn‚Äôt unique to the account holding it. I.e. there is no space for individual metadata that could be used to identify someone. (e.g. It does not associate users to their Discord handle). The account address is the identifier users are connected with and nothing else.\nAdditionally, Badges are consented ‚Äì i.e. they need to be claimed by the holder via signature. This prevents malicious doxxing via airdrop. Issuers cannot send you the Badge, users are just added to the allow-list and may choose to mint or not.\nAfter the season is completed and the Badge has expired (i.e. primary utility is no longer there) the user can choose to burn the Badge if they wish (or keep it as verifiable proof of participation aka. secondary utility).

The plan to use these Otterspace verifiable credentials were signalled and discussed in the Season 6 community vote 4 with a 94% approval and 65 voters.The finalized scope of this pilot is greatly reduced relative to the originally proposed plan to ensure we minimize the effort required to experiment and the time required to get more experientially informed feedback ‚Äì AKA. ‚ÄúGo small, learn faster.‚ÄùThis initiative acts as a proof‚Äìof-concept for using non-transferable NFT protocols but sits inside a larger ‚Äúfabric of change\" emerging here at bDAO. We‚Äôd like to acknowledge that this experiment meshes nicely with related work being done on tokenomics/subscriptions, guest pass revamp, and general reputation/governance-based initiatives. The learnings from this small experiment can be used to support each of these in the following way:Guest Pass (@blockboy) [Forum Post 2] - GuestPasses expire, can harden them using Otterspace expiring ntNFTs\nTokenomics (@Icedcool) [Forum Post Soon] - subscriptions/time-lock BANK options ‚Äì ntNFT tech like can have an ‚Äòallow-list‚Äô to mint driven by external contracts\nReputation Based Unlocks (@0xBaer) - if you use reputation data from tools like Showkarma and/or Orange Protocol they can be complimentary methods of allowlisting ntNFT solutions like Otterspace\n\n###\n\n","completion":" About Otterspace\nOtterspace 4 Badges provide DAOs with a new, non-financial coordination primitive to enable richer interactions and a more nuanced participation model.Otterspace is building a flexible and easy-to-use interface for DAOs to harness the power of non-transferable Badges. Badges can enable DAOs to automate access rights & permissions (with Guild & Collab.Land), perform non-financialized governance (with Snapshot), manage community-specific credentials, and create better incentive systems. Badges can be easily designed and issued to members via the Otterspace app interface. Through the API endpoint, members can also be automatically added to an allowlist programmatically. The protocol also supports badge revocation, expiry, and reinstatement, so the community is able to respond to bad actors. The team is also co-authoring a token standard specifically for non-transferable tokens (EIP 4973 1) on top of which they are building an open protocol.\n"}

Using this first contest the DAO and the DAO Governance can continue drilling down within the areas of its members using the jokedao tool. If this is considered valuable, we suggest doing a seasonal temp check of the DAO sentiment.Example:Vote 1, top 3 results: Guilds should be talent pools, Media Focus, Revenue generation.Vote 2 options (drilling down on Revenue generation), ‚ÄúHow can we change our funding requirement to incentivize projects generating revenue for the DAO?‚ÄùThe result will help all involved in governance of the DAO with a sentiment check where the contributor base feels their focus should be, it will (hopefully) be apparent where we‚Äôre currently lacking clarity and/or focus. We feel that the DAO has chosen centralization of sentiment gauging to core contributors who make proposals based on their view of sentiment and DAO priorities within governance. This would enable the masses to set the priorities for the working groups, without interference or scoping in terms of options.For the voting weight we suggest a simple allocation of 100 tokens per BANK holder, making no difference between someone holding 1mBANK or 100 BANK. We‚Äôre looking for wide sentiment and not to pass a snapshot proposal. Whenever we as a DAO can make everyone‚Äôs voices heard we most definitely should aim to take the chance. (To avoid gaming this a snapshot of holder on L1 and Polygon has been taken)To lower the cost for the DAO and to support new governance solutions on Polygon the Polygon DAO team has agreed to cover the cost of creating and distributing the voting tokens to all BANK holders. Anyone participating in the process will only cover the gas fees of Polygon and there will be no financial impact for BanklessDAO (unless the DAO would like to cover the gas of its members).\n\n###\n\n","completion":" Summary\nBACKGROUND\nMISSION & VALUES ALIGNMENT\nAbout jokedao\nJokeDAO üÉè An open-source, collaborative decision-making platform. 7\nPROJECT SUMMARY\nProposed Deliverables\nBRAND USAGE\nSUCCESS METRICS OR KPIS\nNEXT STEPS\nSQUAD BACKGROUND\n"}

As a second step the DAO could then deep dive within any of these topics.\njokedao is a great tool for contests and governance, it allows all voices to be heard and members to vote on their proposal. We suggest sending the same voting weight to all BANK holders as to see what the active community values, not just the whales. Snapshot at 13th September 8:30pm CET.\nPolygon DAO will sponsor MATIC to cover the cost of airdrops to all BANK holders on Polygon, the only cost for voters will be the negligible gas fee on Polygon to submit the vote.\nIf the DAO finds the data useful we suggest implementing this as a part of future governance as a priority check.\nDisclaimer, everyone in the project team is in some part engaged with Polygon and have an interest in Polygon ecosystem growth.\nIn an effort to gauge sentiment around the DAO in an open and seamless way, we propose using the jokedao platform where everyone can submit their prioritized areas and then vote on their own or others suggestions (voting can be split among several proposals). Using this first contest the DAO and the DAO Governance can continue drilling down within the areas of its members using the jokedao tool. If this is considered valuable, we suggest doing a seasonal temp check of the DAO sentiment.Example:Vote 1, top 3 results: Guilds should be talent pools, Media Focus, Revenue generation.Vote 2 options (drilling down on Revenue generation), ‚ÄúHow can we change our funding requirement to incentivize projects generating revenue for the DAO?‚ÄùThe result will help all involved in governance of the DAO with a sentiment check where the contributor base feels their focus should be, it will (hopefully) be apparent where we‚Äôre currently lacking clarity and/or focus. We feel that the DAO has chosen centralization of sentiment gauging to core contributors who make proposals based on their view of sentiment and DAO priorities within governance. This would enable the masses to set the priorities for the working groups, without interference or scoping in terms of options.For the voting weight we suggest a simple allocation of 100 tokens per BANK holder, making no difference between someone holding 1mBANK or 100 BANK. We‚Äôre looking for wide sentiment and not to pass a snapshot proposal. Whenever we as a DAO can make everyone‚Äôs voices heard we most definitely should aim to take the chance. (To avoid gaming this a snapshot of holder on L1 and Polygon has been taken)To lower the cost for the DAO and to support new governance solutions on Polygon the Polygon DAO team has agreed to cover the cost of creating and distributing the voting tokens to all BANK holders. Anyone participating in the process will only cover the gas fees of Polygon and there will be no financial impact for BanklessDAO (unless the DAO would like to cover the gas of its members).\nNEXT STEPS\nCreating the voting token\nAirdrop of tokens\nAnnouncements in Discord (CC+Announcement) and Twitters around the contest\n\n###\n\n","completion":" SQUAD BACKGROUND\nTommyOlofsson, long time contributor to BanklessDAO, joined just after genesis and has contributed to a variation of guilds.

The List of DAOs is already established with over 200+ DAOs listed, so no development cost is needed as the product is in place. A submission document will be created and placed in the DAOlationships channel that can be used to submit a DAO to be added to the directory. Upon form submission by a Bankless DAO member, the DAO will be vetted by the List of DAOs team to ensure it has members, is functioning as a DAO, has proper links, etc. Once approved, the DAO will be added, and the member who submitted it will be given a small amount of BANK Token (5-25). Likewise, members can earn BANK token by submitting a DAO to be archived and updated. This could be because a DAO has met it mission or is no longer active.**Bank Token\nThis proposal requests 35,000 Bank tokens, the current cost of one membership, to start. 35,000/25 (BANK given to each submission) is around 1400 DAOs that can be listed. We list about a DAO a day on the List of DAOs, so this project has a span of approximately 4 years, or 1400/365. Members can submit multiple DAOs to be approved or archived but all submissions must be vetted.**Benefits of collab to the Bankless DAO- The proposed benefits of this collab are:The BANK tokens go directly back to the members.\nCollab creates a living DAO Directory that focuses efforts with List of DAOs.

Token holders often need more context on proposals and help collect the information required to vote on decisions within the DAO. As a result, they often tend not to vote or make uninformed decisions.

In most DAOs, temp check leads to off-chain snapshot votes and eventually to on-chain voting. As a result, an average person Getting lost in this long process of multiple voting rounds is to be expected. Lower voter turnover and unmet quorums hinder the maturing process of DAO.‚Äò‚ÄôGovernance architects and token holders historically believed in delegating voting power to individuals with competence, discipline, and bandwidth to participate in DAOs.

{"prompt":"Given previous sections continue to write the next section\nGuilds As Professional Associations: a new funding model\nOur DAO currently views guilds as talent pools that must be funded through the Grants Committee. However, the DAO will quickly run the treasury dry if we fund guilds without question. So, we need a better way to look at guild funding. This will allow the Grants Committee to put more bandwidth toward identifying how to fund projects rather than stressing over Guild funding.I spoke with a number of guild coordinators to get feedback on membership numbers and pain points. Here are a few commonalities:Membership numbers are very difficult to measure, but they‚Äôre much lower than the number of people holding the tag, the people listed on the guild‚Äôs notion page, or the people in the Sobol bubble.\nMembership retention is really tough: people come and go, whether it‚Äôs because they think they can make more crypto elsewhere, our meetings don‚Äôt fit their timezone, or the vibes aren‚Äôt what they‚Äôre looking for‚Äîthere‚Äôs a lot of ‚Äúpermissionless leaving.‚Äù\nThe gray area between guilds and projects is difficult to define.

Mr. V would remain the treasury coordinator and hand over the governance responsibility to Sandeepdas.Candidate: sandeepdas#2062\nI am going to move out of my role as the LinkedIn Specialist for bDAO at the end of Season 5. One of my primary reasons for stepping down, in spite of the success of LinkedIn in S5 and its‚Äô importance going forward, is because it always felt as a part of the whole pie (but unable to influence and shape anything for the Marketing Guild). I have been involved in the Governance of the MG unofficially through my feedback and contributions to the MG Constitution in S4 and S5. The Governance aspect is a critical component of a Guild‚Äôs success. If I am elected, I would like to make Governance a fundamental part of how the Guild operates on a day-to-day basis, and also around the important functional and budgetary decisions it takes. Effective governance ensures free and fairer participation, the right level of incentives for the right skill sets, driving home the impact of strategic initiatives, and having more impact from the funding we receive each season.

From our Mission, Vision, and Values page:‚ÄúWe will help the world go Bankless by creating user-friendly onramps for people to discover decentralized financial technologies through education, media, and culture.‚ÄùIn my opinion, our funding philosophy should prioritize revenue generation and a strong BANK token. This will lead to a flywheel of projects and set us up to create long-term sustainable impact on the world. I‚Äôve outlined my thoughts on the subject here:BanklessDAO Project Revenue and Ownership Discussion - DRAFT 1 Governance\n  \n  \n    Seeing as how the DAO is not yet sustainable, the most DAO-aligned investment model is most compelling to me. Once we are sustainable we can decentralize our projects. We don‚Äôt have to only use one model. We can use them sequentially. \nProject progression would look like this: \n\nDepartment\nSubDAO\nSeparate Entity\n\nWe can either dilly dally our way to being self-sustaining or we can focus on getting there immediately.

I‚Äôve outlined my thoughts on the subject here:BanklessDAO Project Revenue and Ownership Discussion - DRAFT 1 Governance\n  \n  \n    Seeing as how the DAO is not yet sustainable, the most DAO-aligned investment model is most compelling to me. Once we are sustainable we can decentralize our projects. We don‚Äôt have to only use one model. We can use them sequentially. \nProject progression would look like this: \n\nDepartment\nSubDAO\nSeparate Entity\n\nWe can either dilly dally our way to being self-sustaining or we can focus on getting there immediately. In the former, BANK will slowly bleed to 0 and we might never become self-sustai‚Ä¶TL;DR - We need a strong BANK token to continue to impact the world and the best way to create a strong BANK token is through revenue generation and a strong treasury.Given these goals: sustainability, strong BANK, and impact. How should we get there? Fundamentally, all things will flow from revenue generation. This is what we should be optimizing for, but how we get there is another question. Clearly, we‚Äôre funding projects, but how do we prioritize them?At present, I think about this as a scale between two philosophies: long-term revenue generation and short-term revenue generation.In the long-term case, the DAO will have a high risk tolerance ‚Äî a tolerance for lack of cash flows and for delayed cash flows. The long-term projects will likely take time to fruit (ex: software products/services) but are set to have strong business models once they do (SaaS, tokens, etc).In the short-term case, we‚Äôll have a lower risk tolerance and we‚Äôll cut projects that do not generate revenue ‚Äî or lack a concrete plan to do so ‚Äî and prioritize projects that generate income today. Again, I see these two poles not as an ‚Äúeither/or‚Äù but a dichotomy for us to manage through revenue modeling and rigorous project evaluation. In all cases, projects will be held accountable for the milestones they promise.My thoughts on our goals are ordered here:Be cash flow positive - This means on-chain revenue, clearly stated KPIs and set deliverables that are highly aligned with this goal, and being careful with the money we spend. bDAO is like a nation that must create goods and achieve income; a strong nation should have a strong treasury.\n\n\nBegin incubator phase - Once we have reached ‚Äúescape velocity‚Äù we can begin to fund more ambitious projects. But funded projects have to execute on their promises.Without a clear view of where we are going and what we are trying to accomplish, the path forward towards evaluating and funding projects becomes tenuous at best. Many of the problems we are currently facing are due to a lack of the ability to strategically align behind a clearly stated purpose.In order to create a framework for the strategic prioritization of project evaluation and funding, this post proposes the following Project Evaluation Framework and Optimistic Governance Structure 2.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" Funding Mechanism\n\n"}

As new organizational behavior and information arise, systems must adapt and modify. Our current operational model - grants, guilds, projects, proposals, compensation - was largely ideated between May 4th and June 8th.Six months in, we‚Äôre seeing where the existing operational model is insufficient:In Season 2, the Grants Committee ran out of funding with a month left in the Season, despite increasing the budget by an additional 40% from Season 1\nProjects have come back for funding without a clear way to evaluate whether these projects should be funded a second or third time.\nCommunity voting does not reflect critical evaluation. We largely vote yes without taking the time to evaluate the full scope of a proposal.\n(Related to above) People do not have the bandwidth to participate in proposal discussion\nGrants Committee sometimes does not have sufficient subject matter expertise to evaluate project scope (namely developer projects)\nWe have no way to evaluate the value that a project brings do the DAO when coming back for funding\nCompensation was set at 1000 BANK/hr, back when BANK average 5 cents per token. Today, we sit at 15.\nCompensation varies heavily in the DAO between standard roles like Talent Scout, Guild Coordinator, Secretary, etc.\n\n Grants Committee standardized Guild Coordinapes at 75,000\nL2 contributor status doesn‚Äôt accommodate for Guest Pass members that have shown themselves worthy of L2 status.The points above reflect challenges that come from outgrowing our current framework. Not to mention the new challenges unforeseen:SubDAOs\nToken utility within the ecosystem (eg. Driving utility to BANK token, like using it to make purchases or gating content behind a token threshold via Mintgate  2)As a quick aside, I see the problems broken down into two main categories:\n\n\nContributor Alignment - How do we properly reward active DAO contributors, accounting for the varying skillsets and time commitment people are making?\n\nStrategic Prioritization -  What should we say no to? How do we, as a DAO, learn how to say no?  How do we do this in a way that empowers the community to make decisions while also letting high-context individuals influence outcomes?My point here is that, in Season 0, we directed our attention in working on the organization and building systems/processes. In Season 1 and Season 2, all those same people worked in the organization. Now, we have new information and behavior that are forcing us to re-evaluate those systems/processes that we built.Now you may stop and say, ‚ÄúWell okay, why don‚Äôt we just spin up a working group in this‚Ä¶? Let‚Äôs just find a bunch of people interested in solving these problems and let‚Äôs get on with it!‚Äù Good question! I tried. Nearly 3 months ago, I created this forum post: ALL HANDS ON DECK: Compensation and PLM Working Groups  2. In it, I called for a group of interested parties to help scope out our inadequate compensation guidance. The result? Despite having 15 people signal their interest  2, we only met three times and we delivered on this flimsy forum post  2.I see this failure resulting from two factors:Our working group did not have explicit signaling from the DAO that this was a major priority. We‚Äôre all fucking busy in our respective niches. Without an explicit mandate from the DAO saying ‚ÄúThis is important, we need people on this project,‚Äù it‚Äôs really difficult to activate people to redirect their resources and attention on this matter.\nI did not have the time and bandwidth to lead this working group. I was active in a number of different places in the DAO, and without some social signal and explicitly incentivization, it eventually fell down my priority list.Given my experience here, I want to propose a new model - One that creates an explicit mandate from the DAO to focus on these two problem areas and properly incentivizes participation.Ladies, Gentlemen, and non-binaries, I‚Äôd like to introduce the Governance Solutions Engineer Program\n"}

Nearly 3 months ago, I created this forum post: ALL HANDS ON DECK: Compensation and PLM Working Groups  2. In it, I called for a group of interested parties to help scope out our inadequate compensation guidance. The result? Despite having 15 people signal their interest  2, we only met three times and we delivered on this flimsy forum post  2.I see this failure resulting from two factors:Our working group did not have explicit signaling from the DAO that this was a major priority. We‚Äôre all fucking busy in our respective niches. Without an explicit mandate from the DAO saying ‚ÄúThis is important, we need people on this project,‚Äù it‚Äôs really difficult to activate people to redirect their resources and attention on this matter.\nI did not have the time and bandwidth to lead this working group. I was active in a number of different places in the DAO, and without some social signal and explicitly incentivization, it eventually fell down my priority list.Given my experience here, I want to propose a new model - One that creates an explicit mandate from the DAO to focus on these two problem areas and properly incentivizes participation.Ladies, Gentlemen, and non-binaries, I‚Äôd like to introduce the Governance Solutions Engineer Program\n\n###\n\n","completion":" MISSION & VALUES ALIGNMENT\nI‚Äôm going to be lazy here, but in the Onwards to Season 3! forum post, I did a quick temp check on this topic with overwhelming support of a focus on Governance and Coordination:Screenshot 2022-01-04 180620893√ó445 23.9 KB\n"}

Token holders often need more context on proposals and help collect the information required to vote on decisions within the DAO. As a result, they often tend not to vote or make uninformed decisions.

In most DAOs, temp check leads to off-chain snapshot votes and eventually to on-chain voting. As a result, an average person Getting lost in this long process of multiple voting rounds is to be expected. Lower voter turnover and unmet quorums hinder the maturing process of DAO.‚Äò‚ÄôGovernance architects and token holders historically believed in delegating voting power to individuals with competence, discipline, and bandwidth to participate in DAOs.

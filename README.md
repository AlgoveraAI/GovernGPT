# üèó GovernGPT

This project aims to develop GovernGPT which assists governors and professional delegates in DAOs to build and summarise proposals. This proposal is specifically geared to support [DAOStewards](https://bankless.notion.site/DAOstewards-24f0aba00eb743459f554fca9a8c9847) a meta-governance group from BanklessDAO with active delegations in Euler.Finance, SAFE DAO & 1inchDAO.

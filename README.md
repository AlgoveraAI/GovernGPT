# üèó GovernGPT

This project aims to develop GovernGPT which assists governors and professional delegates in DAOs to build and summarise proposals. This proposal is specifically geared to support [DAOStewards](https://bankless.notion.site/DAOstewards-24f0aba00eb743459f554fca9a8c9847) a meta-governance group from BanklessDAO with active delegations in Euler.Finance, SAFE DAO & 1inchDAO. 

You can read more about the project [here](https://forum.algovera.ai/t/proposal-gpt3-for-dao-governance/307). 

# ü§ñ Algovera Flow

This workflow will soon be added to the [Algovera platform](https://app.algovera.ai/workflows). Check it out if you're interested in using this workflow (and others) to augment your daily work with LLMs. 

# üë™ Grants 

You can get funded to build your LLM workflow through Algovera Grants. Each month, we give out $10k of grants to projects. For examples of previous proposals, check out our [forum](https://forum.algovera.ai/). For more information on the proposal process, check out our [docs](https://docs.algovera.ai/blog/).

- `data_cleaner.rb`: Data Cleaner that cleans out the unneccessary HTML tags from the scraped governance proposals
- `prepare_dataset.rb`: Convert HTML into the structured JSON format that contains title, headings, and sections. This JSON is used in turn to generate prompt/output pairs for OpenAI GPT model fine-tuning
- `prepare_prompts.rb`: Script that converts the scraped data in JSON format into the prompts/outputs used to fine-tune GPT.

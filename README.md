# üèó GovernGPT

This project aims to develop GovernGPT which assists governors and professional delegates in DAOs to build and summarise proposals. This proposal is specifically geared to support [DAOStewards](https://bankless.notion.site/DAOstewards-24f0aba00eb743459f554fca9a8c9847) a meta-governance group from BanklessDAO with active delegations in Euler.Finance, SAFE DAO & 1inchDAO. 

You can read more about the project [here](https://forum.algovera.ai/t/proposal-gpt3-for-dao-governance/307). 

# ü§ñ Algovera Flow

This workflow will soon be added to the [Algovera platform](https://app.algovera.ai/workflows). Check it out if you're interested in using this workflow (and others) to augment your daily work with LLMs.

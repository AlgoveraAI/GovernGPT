<p>A whole DAO ban, based on sharing in Research Guild.</p>
<p>A question asked in RG was are there any topics for research. SInce I’m researching into WG / Guild / Project / DAO workflows, I wanted to share my recent article, which has been approved for publication by Bankless Publication.</p>

<p>I view this instant ban as needless, crude, detrimental to DAO health, and unjustly exclusionary. I thought DAOs were open door, inclusive, creative kinds of places.</p>
<p>Actually I think bDAO still is a great place, but that this is a crude piece of bot design of the worst order. And I also think bDAO can do better in its bot design. How so?</p>
<p><strong>AI Ethics</strong><br>
This is a hot topic across the digital world, and I’d hope bDAO can show AI Ethics in action.</p>
<p>Surely, making bot design that involves bDAO contributors should have a voting mechanism attached, for the sake of ethics? And that this voting mechanism is made public during bot design and before commissioning any dev work, to better understand “unintended consequences”?</p>
<p><strong>Bot Design</strong><br>
If this design is intended on a per channel / guild basis, then channels / guilds need to opt in, and say they are doing so in their start here channels. Timeouts and bans should not be on a Discord wide basis, and I suggest 2 days or more is a crazy time span unless for persistent offenders, POs. (NB Subsequent discovery, the 2 days is on my mobile, not the desktop!) For POs, I believe Discord itself can ban offenders, and for now that this is a manual last resort. Maybe bot design can handle this, but I refer to my comments above about AI Ethics.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Where is the community learning curve design in the bot design thinking?</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Community Learning Curves</strong><br>
If the Guild wants its community to learn, then have warning stages that the bot operates to.</p>
<ol>
<li>First warning: risk and length of timeout / ban</li>
<li>Final warning: imminent timeout / ban, risk and length</li>
<li>Timeout / ban</li>
</ol>
<p>Overriding ethos: what do warning recipients need to do to avoid timeouts?</p>
<p>This at least incorporates a learning curve, and on a guild by guild, project by project etc. basis</p>
<p>I welcome thoughts and suggestions here, current bot design may make life easier for role holders, but it will dismay genuine contributors and bDAO enthusiasts.</p>
<p>Please indicate your support for this, or list your objections, I’m happy to discuss.</p></div><section class="post-menu-area clearfix"><nav class="post-controls expanded"><div class="actions"><div class="double-button"><button class="widget-button btn-flat toggle-like like no-text btn-icon" title="like this post" data-post-id="13995"><svg class="fa d-icon d-icon-d-unliked svg-icon svg-node" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="#far-heart"></use></svg></button></div><button class="widget-button btn-flat share no-text btn-icon" title="share a link to this post"><svg class="fa d-icon d-icon-d-post-share svg-icon svg-node" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="#link"></use></svg></button></div></nav></section></div>

<a name="summary-1" class="anchor" href="#summary-1"></a>Summary:</h1>
<p>Project Assessment Framework is a methodology which the grants committee can employ to conduct quantitative and qualitative analysis on project proposals and assign a risk score. This risk score helps the GC to make objective decisions on grant requests.</p>
<h1>
<a name="specification-2" class="anchor" href="#specification-2"></a>Specification:</h1>
<p>The assessment framework consists of multiple questions grouped in chapters (criteria). A project reviewer would use score guidelines to assign a certain value to each question. All the answers given by the different project reviewers to one question are then aggregated to generate an average score. Finally all these averages scores together are averaged again and the final project score generated. The chapters themselves are currently not weighted.</p>

<a name="what-is-a-risk-score-3" class="anchor" href="#what-is-a-risk-score-3"></a>What is a risk score?</h3>
<p>A risk score is a numerical representation of an inherent project risk. The risk score is derived from weighing and averaging qualitative or quantitative evaluations. A score of 1 means the project is least risky under any given criteria and a score of 5 means that the project is most risky under any given criteria.</p>
<h3>
<a name="what-is-a-scoring-guide-4" class="anchor" href="#what-is-a-scoring-guide-4"></a>What is a scoring guide?</h3>
<p>A scoring guide describes objective and subjective metrics to be used by the reviewer when scoring. These assist the reviewer in making unbiased decisions.</p>
<h3>
<a name="how-are-projects-scored-5" class="anchor" href="#how-are-projects-scored-5"></a>How are projects scored?</h3>
<p>At least 4 GC members need to evaluate each project and fill out the score card.</p>
<p>Recommendations based on cumulative score</p>

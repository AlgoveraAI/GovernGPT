<div class="regular contents"><div class="cooked"><p>Translators Guild has a budget of 75,000 BANK and a bounty budget of 34,000 BANK for season 3.</p>
<p>While discussing the funding for the proposed POG-project, questions were raised on</p>
<ol>
<li>How much of the overall project budget can be allocated to a single project to still leave sufficient funding for future projects and</li>
<li>If the bounty budget could be utilized for early project tasks.</li>
</ol>
<p>Proposed by Translators Guild Coordinator Grendel and discussed during the weekly guild call on January 27th, 2022 a consensus seemed to be reached that there should be a maximum of 15% to 33% of there overall budget for single projects.</p>
<p>The maximum of 33% (1/3) derived from the idea of splitting the seasonal budget into 3 parts (one for each month) which could be claimable by a project if it is the only project in a given month that asks for funding.</p>
<p>As a second part it should be decided if the bounty budget could be utilized by projects or not.</p>
<p>To open the discussion:</p>
<ol>
<li>Should there be a funding limit for a single project and if so how high should that be?</li>
<li>Should the bounty budget be utilized to support project related roles/task in the early stages? If so what should be the maximum amount for a bounty?</li>

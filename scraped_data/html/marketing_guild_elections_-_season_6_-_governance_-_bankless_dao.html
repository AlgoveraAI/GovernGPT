<p>As Mr. V needs to free up some time he suggested splitting the role into two parts (Governance and Treasury) and also splitting the salary. Mr. V would remain the treasury coordinator and hand over the governance responsibility to Sandeepdas.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Candidate: sandeepdas#2062</strong><br>
I am going to move out of my role as the LinkedIn Specialist for bDAO at the end of Season 5. One of my primary reasons for stepping down, in spite of the success of LinkedIn in S5 and its‚Äô importance going forward, is because it always felt as a part of the whole pie (but unable to influence and shape anything for the Marketing Guild). I have been involved in the Governance of the MG unofficially through my feedback and contributions to the MG Constitution in S4 and S5. The Governance aspect is a critical component of a Guild‚Äôs success. If I am elected, I would like to make Governance a fundamental part of how the Guild operates on a day-to-day basis, and also around the important functional and budgetary decisions it takes. Effective governance ensures free and fairer participation, the right level of incentives for the right skill sets, driving home the impact of strategic initiatives, and having more impact from the funding we receive each season. My governance vision, in addition to realizing the above objectives, will also frame how the MG should create its own distinct identity, create a center of excellence, and strengthen bDAO‚Äôs image and perception as the biggest media DAO.</p>

As current Governance and Treasury Role Holder since season 3, I intend to serve the guild moving forward. However, my time does not allow for this role fully so I suggested splitting the responsibility and not running for governance. This way I can focus on continuing timely payouts and guild remuneration while the governance coordinator can focus the time on improving the framework.</p>

Marketing was my major and I was working for the largest PR company in China and I always find it fascinating.

It‚Äôs my first day in bDAO and I would love to start from a simple role that can help me understand how a DAO level marketing strategy would be like. I can help with project planning and strategy designs. I can help with marketing on LinkedIn(I worked for couple months there) and write content in Chinese so bDAO would have a better reach within Chinese audiences.

As this new role set in S5 and I have been standing in the role through all S5, everything started from 0, and building to 0.3 (I think) through all this S5, we</p>
<ul>
<li>created sustainable and healthy bounty task flow</li>
<li>building templates for various media assets</li>
<li>setting the work flow for content creation</li>
<li>gathering and sorting out content pipeline and content calendar</li>
<li>connecting different guilds and projects for content input</li>
<li>trying our best to well allocate various talents (design, copy writing and video editing, etc) for different tasks/opportunities</li>
</ul>
<p>These are what we have been building through S5, not perfect but trying to settle things.And loads of efforts have been spent on coordination, documentation and communication. It‚Äôs never been easy as I expected in S4, but it worths. It‚Äôs challenging and totally fresh experience for me to work as a role in DAO.  But I do hope I can continue this, to carry this uneasy ‚Äú0.3‚Äù to ‚Äú0.6‚Äù even the perfect ‚Äú1‚Äù or more.Here is the outlook I will strive for:</p>
<ol>
<li>Content work-flow: A settled sorted pipeline and calendar with good clarity for everyone in mkt guild and for who would love to collaborate with mkt guild</li>
<li>Documentation: A good documentation system for content creation and feedback to related content.</li>
<li>Content Creation: get the efficient way to create content(particularly the video content), and leverage content to help the growth on TikTok, Instagram, Facebook and Telegram, even expand more media outlet like gm.xyz, etc.</li>
<li>Find out if there is any possibilities to package the content as a product to satisfy clients/partners, even sell as the service to various campaigns.</li>
<li>Plug-in Talent: Collaborate with talent coordinator, attract more talents to build and make ppl here enjoy building with mkt guild.</li>
</ol>
<p>Have been learning a lot from teams and pals in mkt guild.

Little background about my contributions and work. Started contributing to the DAO in s2. Since then, I have done a fair bit of work in the marketing guild by filming for TikTok (i do the talking in every video) and design work for the design guild and bankless card. Looking at the current state of our TikTok, I think its no where near the same quality as it was before I left the role. I want to take over this role, because I fully believe that I can bring back the s2-s3 quality and views to the current content. For example, the videos I make with Rony get 350-1500 views, while the latest content gets only around 40-180 views. I think its time for a change of the role holder. <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@thebanklessdao/video/7038327854366641455?is_from_webapp=1&amp;sender_device=pc&amp;web_id=7153291109434197509" class="inline-onebox" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">Join Bankless Discord server, Link in bioüìàüî• #foryou #crypto #bitcoin #eth #bankless #banklessdao #doge #shib</a></p>

Marketing was my major and I was working for the largest PR company in China and I always find it fascinating. I would say there‚Äôs much more opportunities here in web3 by redefining the 4Cs, build a recommendation system that user have better control. It‚Äôs my first day in bDAO and I would love to start from a simple role that can help me understand how a DAO level marketing strategy would be like. I can help with project planning and strategy designs. I can help with marketing on LinkedIn(I worked for couple months there) and write content in Chinese so bDAO would have a better reach within Chinese audiences. <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/liangzhi-lz-chen-96b815160/" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">https://www.linkedin.com/in/liangzhi-lz-chen-96b815160/ <span class="badge badge-notification clicks" title="1 click">1</span></a></p>

<p>Do your best to be realistic in expectations and tie your funding ask to what is achievable with that amount of money. You can always ask for more funding in the future as your idea continues to progress to furthering degrees of complexity. Start with the MVP, then V1, V2, and so on.</p>
<h1>
<a name="specification-5" class="anchor" href="#specification-5"></a>SPECIFICATION</h1>
<p>Explain the project in detail. You’re expected to have done your homework and the more exact numbers and implementation details, the more likely the proposal will be approved. Include squad details, including any positions that have yet to be filled (e.g., you need to add someone from the dev guild to the squad).</p>
<p>You can get creative with the formatting of this section. For example, feel free to break it up into multiple specifications, include a project plan, or explain how the project will achieve its objectives in some other way.</p>
<h1>
<a name="financial-implications-6" class="anchor" href="#financial-implications-6"></a>FINANCIAL IMPLICATIONS</h1>
<p>Include details about funding requirements. You must include a detailed breakdown that explains how the funds will be allocated. Funding will not be approved for proposals without a funding breakdown. This is where the squad can request rewards for their expected contributions to the project, including any work done to scope the project and create the proposal.</p>
<p>This section only needs to be completed for projects that are requesting funding. If you are requesting seasonal funding, add a “Requesting Season [season #] Funding” tag to the project on the DAO project page prior to the snapshot vote for the seasonal projects.</p>

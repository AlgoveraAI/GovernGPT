<h3>
<a name="authors-icedcool-hashedmae-2" class="anchor" href="#authors-icedcool-hashedmae-2"></a>Authors: Icedcool, HashedMae</h3>
<p>This post is to kick off a discussion on revenue, and ownership at the DAO, which has implications in terms of alignment to the DAO, responsibilities of projects to the DAO, responsibilities of the DAO to projects, and other implications. Acknowledging that technically the DAO owns all projects, we wanted to facilitate the conversation in being more explicit to support clear decision making going forward.</p>
<hr>
<p>As BanklessDAO projects are moving towards maturity, the decisions around how to structure their revenue, funding and overall governance becomes increasingly important. These structures are relevant as they define the financial impact back to the DAO, and who can make decisions around that. As some projects consider taking outside funding, how they should do that becomes pertinent. Ultimately this question is about, should projects distribute their own tokens for investing, encourage investing to the DAO with funds earmarked in some way for the project, a combination of the above, or something completely different.</p>
<p>This post is certainly not exhaustive, but we wanted to at least present some different options and ideas. As projects mature, this will help them define how they will set up their revenue and alignment.</p>
<p>Some implications that we think should be acknowledged are that investing may come with additional requirements from the investor that can alter alignments for projects. Additionally, by the Grants Committee funding projects, they maintain alignment and accountability to the DAO.</p>

<a name="scope-3" class="anchor" href="#scope-3"></a>Scope:</h2>
<p>To define, and recommend ownership structures to support the long term valuation and recompense of the DAO from projects.</p>
<p>An important distinction is for projects that are internal services vs revenue generating projects. This document is to define and make recommendations for revenue generating projects.</p>
<p>Internal services(like guilds, or training) may never generate revenue, although a separate post explicitly defining the relationship from the DAO to these, is important and necessary.</p>
<p>This list is not exhaustive, more to present ideas and options for the DAO to discuss, and ultimately vote on as a recommended ownership model.</p>
<p>Additionally, this document is to serve to support the Grants Committee’s decision making process and potentially require projects to have a revenue and investing model section.</p>
<h2>
<a name="investing-models-4" class="anchor" href="#investing-models-4"></a>Investing Models:</h2>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Incubator Model</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Project receives funding from Grants Committee</li>
<li>Sources talent from guilds</li>
<li>Seeks revenue and compensates based on a VC/Investor model
<ul>
<li>X% revenue to the DAO
<ul>
<li>For perpetuity? (NFT Flipper)</li>
<li>Or one time revenue? (DAOPunks)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Y% revenue to the Project Multisig
<ul>
<li>Compensation is decided upon internally, ie coordinape, percents, etc.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>May create a token to support equity distribution for investing.
<ul>
<li>Would be expected to grant the DAO a portion of tokens, to be discussed and approved with the DAO and/or Grants Committee.</li>
<li>Investors would purchase tokens/equity for a claim on the revenue of the project in exchange for agreed upon alternative token(stable tokens, etc).</li>
<li>Tokens would also be distributed to core contributors.
<ul>
<li>Depending upon governance of the project.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Ultimately seeks independence from the DAO, potentially as a subDAO, or its own DAO.
<ul>
<li>Ex, DAOPunks</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Department Model</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Project lives within the DAO, using DAO resources, infrastructure and the DAO provides overhead support, ie legal, marketing, etc</li>
<li>Project is a component of BanklessDAO</li>
<li>Project receives funding from Grants Committee</li>
<li>Sources Talent from Guilds</li>
<li>Seeks revenue, and investing would accrue to the BanklessDAO Multisig
<ul>
<li>Investing may or may not be earmarked.
<ul>
<li>In the case of earmark, BANK funding would be secured to the valuation of the investing.
<ul>
<li>30 Day MA (?)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>In the case of no earmark, the project would have to go to the GC to request funding seasonally. - Doesn’t really make sense but for exploration purposes including.</li>
<li>Earmarked allocations should take into account the overhead costs of the resources provided by the DAO</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Funding to be distributed in the form of BANK.</li>
<li>BanklessDAO would be expected to continue to fund the project</li>
<li>Revenue would accrue to the BanklessDAO Multisig
<ul>
<li>This would be to compensate the DAO for the overhead provided</li>
<li>Potentially allows for a quicker path to where the DAO is not solely reliant on the value of BANK</li>
<li>Aligns with goal of treasury diversification</li>
<li>Creates potential for BANK as a utility token, where the project is collecting revenue in BANK which then flows back to the DAO treasury</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Project would continue to request funding, perhaps annually or bi-annually.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Ultimately the project would be expected to continue on within the DAO.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>A combination - Subdao model?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Distributes token so that investors can purchase a specific claim on the project without investing in the DAO and being exposed to all DAO projects.
<ul>
<li>X% to be sold, Y% is held by the DAO (maybe 50/50?)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Project continually seeks funding from the Grants Committee.
<ul>
<li>Maintains alignment to the DAO.</li>
<li>Is accountable to the DAO for performance.
<ul>
<li>Depending on the relationship with investors.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Compensates project contributors continually with a combination of BANK and invested token. (stable tokens, etc)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Sources talent from guilds</li>
<li>Utilizes DAO resources and infrastructure
<ul>
<li>Marketing, Legal, etc.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>DAO maintains ownership stake in the project rather than just revenue share (% may come down to project by project basis, would need to establish a process for evaluation).</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>

<p>As stated, this list is NOT exhaustive, but is to kick off discussion around different revenue and investing models.</p>
<p>We welcome all thoughts and discussion.</p></div><section class="post-menu-area clearfix"><nav class="post-controls expanded"><div class="actions"><div class="double-button"><button class="widget-button btn-flat button-count like-count highlight-action regular-likes btn-icon-text" title="6 people liked this post" aria-label="6 people liked this post.

<div class="regular contents"><div class="cooked"><p>This idea came to me while working on a strategy to decentralize a POS chain.</p>
<p>This conversation is to take a temperature check on what other bDAO members think.</p>
<p>It’s rather simple.</p>
<p>Have project proposers score themselves.</p>
<p>The process would like the DAO will set a fixed periodic project intake date ie Feb1,May 1st, etc.</p>
<p>On the project selection date, the project proposers form the selection committee that will prioritize the projects. Each proposer will score competing projects, but not their own.</p>
<p>The scoring process is moderated by a neutral coordinator.</p>
<p>The scores are tabulated, and project priority is established.</p>
<p>Bounty: scoring coordinator X times per year</p>
<p>Bounty: To make the initial project scorecard, collect the feedback after scoring, and review or update the scorecard as needed x times per year.</p>
<p>Done.</p>
<p>In the longer term, once proven, this could be automated with no coordinator.</p>
<p>To be clear, this idea addresses how to prioritize bDAO projects.</p>
<p>How to determine funding levels and funding allocation would be a different mechanism.</p>
<p>Let’s ideate on the funding step.</p>
<p>Wah say U?</p></div><section class="post-menu-area clearfix"><nav class="post-controls expanded"><button class="widget-button btn-flat show-replies btn-icon-text" title="1 Reply" aria-label="This post has 1 reply.

<p>Grendel recently stepped down from the grants committee and due to this the Grants Committee has a vacant seat.</p>
<p>This post is to take applicants to fill that position, based on the initialization spec(<a href="https://forum.bankless.community/t/draft1-banklessdao-season-1-proposal/904#grants-committee-10">link</a>).</p>
<p>The Grants Committee consists of 5-7 members along with a multisig with all committee members as signers.</p>
<ul>

</ul>
<p><strong>The voting period will last one week and will take place on Snapshot:</strong></p>
<ul>

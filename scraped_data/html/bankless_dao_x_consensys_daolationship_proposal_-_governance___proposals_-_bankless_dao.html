<h1>
<a name="summary-1" class="anchor" href="#summary-1"></a>SUMMARY</h1>
<p>ConsenSys is seeking the opportunity to onboard some of their employees to the Bankless DAO in order to help the DAO across various guilds and projects, allowing their employees to learn how to effectively explore DAO culture, experiment with external contribution in the DAO community and continuously provide value to the wider Ethereum ecosystem.</p>
<p>As part of this DAOlationship proposal, ConsenSys would like to secure 50 Guest Passes for a 3 month period so that ConsenSys employees can have a trial period to experience the Bankless DAO prior to independently joining the Bankless DAO (i.e. purchasing 35,000 BANK tokens on their own) and potentially contributing if they should choose to do so.</p>
<p>In addition, Bankless DAO will offer additional stewardship, educational materials and support to an agreed upon capacity and ConsenSys will allocate an equal value to this partnership.</p>
<p>At ConsenSys, we encourage all employees to dedicate at least one full day every month to third party initiatives external to ConsenSys—namely, DAOs. This is an org-wide plan for employees to migrate to a contributor model, unbundle the mystic DAO ecosystem, and to “green pill” our people into becoming fully consumed by web3 culture.</p>
<h1>
<a name="background-2" class="anchor" href="#background-2"></a>BACKGROUND</h1>
<p>ConsenSys is making this proposal because we are committed to bettering both the overall Ethereum ecosystem and the DAO ecosystem and we believe that a DAOlationship with Bankless will result in several positive outcomes for both parties as well as learning outcomes that the overall community will benefit from.</p>
<p>Positive Outcomes - Bankless</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Bankless DAO will gain access to potentially valuable contributors who have the opportunity to contribute some of their working hours to third party initiatives external to ConsenSys—namely, DAOs.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Bankless DAO may be able to increase the output of various guilds if these working relationships prove to be fruitful; in turn, this will increase the footprint of the Bankless brand</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Bankless DAO will have a direct line of communication with a steward from the ConsenSys team to ensure that all parties are satisfied with the relationship; specifically, it is less likely that contributors will disappear or become disengaged as can sometimes be the case with individual contributors</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Positive Outcomes - ConsenSys</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Allow ConsenSys employees to experiment with contributing to one of the most respected DAOs in the ecosystem</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>ConsenSys employees will gain insight into how a well functioning DAO organizes and operates</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>ConsenSys employees will be able to expand their horizons in terms of the types of work that can be completed in DAOs and potentially find new areas of interest (ex. writing / research / operations / marketing) that they may not be exposed to in their day-to-day work life</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Learning Outcomes - Both Parties</p>
<ul>
<li>Strengthen the DAO onboarding process for both parties and learn previously unrecognized insights about DAO onboarding</li>
</ul>
<h1>
<a name="mission-values-alignment-3" class="anchor" href="#mission-values-alignment-3"></a>MISSION &amp; VALUES ALIGNMENT</h1>
<p>The Bankless DAO mission and values are as follows:</p>
<p><img src="https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/twitter/small_orange_diamond.png?v=12" title=":small_orange_diamond:" class="emoji" alt=":small_orange_diamond:" loading="lazy" width="20" height="20" style="aspect-ratio: 20 / 20;"> Mission: We will help the world go Bankless by creating user-friendly onramps for people to discover decentralized financial technologies through education, media, and culture.</p>
<p><img src="https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/twitter/small_orange_diamond.png?v=12" title=":small_orange_diamond:" class="emoji" alt=":small_orange_diamond:" loading="lazy" width="20" height="20" style="aspect-ratio: 20 / 20;"> Vision: To live in a world where anyone with an internet connection has access to the financial tools needed to achieve financial independence</p>
<p><img src="https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/twitter/small_orange_diamond.png?v=12" title=":small_orange_diamond:" class="emoji" alt=":small_orange_diamond:" loading="lazy" width="20" height="20" style="aspect-ratio: 20 / 20;"> Values: Education, Integrity, Decentralized Governance, and Culture</p>
<p><img src="https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/twitter/red_circle.png?v=12" title=":red_circle:" class="emoji" alt=":red_circle:" loading="lazy" width="20" height="20" style="aspect-ratio: 20 / 20;"> Education: We learn from each other. We seek to become a trusted guide that empowers people all over the globe to adopt decentralized finance by sharing accurate, truthful, and objective information.</p>
<p><img src="https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/twitter/red_circle.png?v=12" title=":red_circle:" class="emoji" alt=":red_circle:" loading="lazy" width="20" height="20" style="aspect-ratio: 20 / 20;"> Integrity: We operate transparently and build trust through radically public discourse and financial auditability.</p>
<p><img src="https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/twitter/red_circle.png?v=12" title=":red_circle:" class="emoji" alt=":red_circle:" loading="lazy" width="20" height="20" style="aspect-ratio: 20 / 20;"> Decentralized Governance: We put decision making into the hands of the collective. We create legitimacy through an environment where the best ideas win.</p>
<p><img src="https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/twitter/red_circle.png?v=12" title=":red_circle:" class="emoji" alt=":red_circle:" loading="lazy" width="20" height="20" style="aspect-ratio: 20 / 20;"> Culture: We reward action and embrace risk. We empower our community to continually drive new initiatives by providing a space to self-organize and quickly move from idea to action.</p>
<p>ConsenSys values are as follows:</p>
<p>We act with kindness.</p>
<p>We continually evolve.</p>
<p>We cultivate community.</p>
<p>We embrace innovation.</p>
<p>We deliver impact.</p>
<p>As you can see, there is a lot of overlap between the core values of both Bankless and ConsenSys. In particular, both parties aim to educate and onboard as many people as possible into the Ethereum ecosystem and to help all citizens of the world to evolve and embrace innovation.</p>
<p>By partnering with ConsenSys, the Bankless DAO will be able to further their mission by gaining access to potential contributors who share these same values and who have a proven track record of delivering on projects across various departments (guilds).</p>
<h1>
<a name="scope-of-work-4" class="anchor" href="#scope-of-work-4"></a>SCOPE OF WORK</h1>
<p>As part of this proposal, ConsenSys employees will be encouraged to identify 1-2 guilds and 1-2 work stream/active workgroups for their potential contributions during this 3 month trial period. In addition, it is highly encouraged that ConsenSys employees join the weekly calls of their selected guilds as well as the DAO-wide community call on Friday’s at 3pm UTC.</p>

<p>BanklessDAO (referred to as “bDAO”) is a decentralized community dedicated to stewarding the Bankless movement through media, culture, and education.</p>
<p><strong>Since launch, bDAO has become a flourishing community with 15,000 Discord members and 4,525 token holders, catalyzing a number of promising initiatives ranging from content generation (the Rug, Decentralized Law, State of the DAOs, and more), education (Bankless Academy), consulting (Bankless Consulting), engineering and development work (Degen, Bounty Board), community NFT and merch sales, and new financial products (BED and GMI with IndexCoop).</strong></p>
<p>PrimeDAO is a collective of DeFi builders and DAOists focused on researching and building next-generation coordination tools for decentralized organizations. Their mission is to enable DAOs to build a stronger ecosystem across web3. PrimeDAO provides crucial infrastructure and accessibility tools for both incumbents and new players allowing DAOs to be more resilient through cooperation and community.</p>

Additionally BanklessDAO could benefit from utilizing some of the key products being developed by PrimeDAO.</p>

<div class="regular contents"><div class="cooked"><p>As of October 22, the Grants Committee has voted unanimously to expel member Ap0ll0517 in the middle of his term for absenteeism.</p>
<p>Below I will lay the timeline out for you to review how we came to this conclusion.</p>
<p>Above all, we hope that Ap0ll0 is doing well and is able to rejoin the DAO soon.</p>

<p>During the <a href="https://bankless.notion.site/Grants-Committee-Weekly-Oct-11-2022-7f8f97055a5542278fec715502576118" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">October 11 GC weekly meeting <span class="badge badge-notification clicks" title="2 clicks">2</span></a>, it became apparent that Apollo was not attending meetings or responding to messages. There were no indications that this time off</p>
<p>Upon further inspection, we noted that his last message posted in the GC chat as well as the DAO server was not since <a href="https://discord.com/channels/834499078434979890/989105371471814727/1024380618370469888" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">Sep 22 <span class="badge badge-notification clicks" title="1 click">1</span></a>, over 2 weeks. This is still the case today.</p>
<p>I personally reached out via Discord and Telegram, but have still received no reply.</p>
<p>With the looming S6 GC election, it dawned on us that the timing of a potential replacement was “ideal” and if Apollo was removed or stepped down, he could be replaced in the same election - preventing a singleton Snapshot election.</p>
<p>That kicked off a discussion about the Grants Committee’s internal ability to dismiss fellow members.</p>
<h2>

</h2>
<p>Could we dismiss a member?</p>
<p>At first, the assumption was that we would need to go to Snapshot to add/remove all members, but upon further inspection the <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1qPekq1FReEmni2moHDSteGnrHCnFePc4S2IMyQn3dbE/edit" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">S5 Spec <span class="badge badge-notification clicks" title="2 clicks">2</span></a> only refers to the limitations for adding members: “The Committee cannot change the application process to be a Committee member.”</p>
<p>Notably, the GC is “otherwise responsible for their own operations”.</p>
<p>The combination of these two facts led us to consider that, so long as quorum could still be met, the GC could dismiss a member with a unanimous vote (excluding the member in question).</p>
<h2>
<a name="procedure-3" class="anchor" href="#procedure-3"></a><strong>Procedure</strong>
</h2>
<p>So, we first established an asynchronous vote to confirm what we believed: the GC could dismiss a member. This passed.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://discord.com/channels/834499078434979890/1013891484728164472/1030175730044248125" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">Poll <span class="badge badge-notification clicks" title="4 clicks">4</span></a></li>
<li><a href="https://bankless.notion.site/Grants-Committee-Procedure-for-Member-Dismissal-16439e7c768c42f791ab6720f60d2856" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">Procedure <span class="badge badge-notification clicks" title="1 click">1</span></a></li>
</ul>
<p>Then, a follow up poll was posted to the <a href="https://forum.bankless.community/t/community-vote-season-6/4441">S6 Community Vote</a> to confirm that with the community sentiment. We acknowledged that if the community voted against it, we would escalate the matter to a Snapshot.</p>
<p>Lastly, an asynchronous vote was created for <a href="https://discord.com/channels/834499078434979890/1013891484728164472/1032951632708771921" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">the dismissal of Ap0ll0517 <span class="badge badge-notification clicks" title="3 clicks">3</span></a>. This passed with 6 of 6 members voting yes.</p>

</h2>
<p>At present, the incoming election has more than enough applicants to fill the additional vacancy.</p>
<p>The member who replaces Apollo should serve a half term (one season) to maintain a more equitable turnover in the future (avoid replacing 5 members every other season).</p>
<p>The GC recommends that the member with the 5th most votes take this half term.</p>
<p>Again, we don’t take this outcome lightly and hope that Ap0ll0 is well &amp; rejoins us at the DAO soon.</p></div><section class="post-menu-area clearfix"><nav class="post-controls expanded"><div class="actions"><div class="double-button"><button class="widget-button btn-flat button-count like-count highlight-action regular-likes btn-icon-text" title="6 people liked this post" aria-label="6 people liked this post.

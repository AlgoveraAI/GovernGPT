This is an edit of the Super Season 5 proposal to make a four-month season for Season 4 rather than a three or six-month season. Based on discussions in the #seasons channel and feedback from many contributors, a four-month season (16-weeks) seems to be a happy medium.
The schedule of a 16-week season would be:
Break week: April 4-8
Season 4 Start: April 18
Founding Day/One Year Anniversary: May 4
Permissionless: May 17-19
Break Week: August 8-12
Season 5 Start: August 15-19
For reasoning on why Iâ€™m proposing a longer season, I refer you to the original Super Season 5 post.
Ways to keep project alignment and meet goals during a 33% longer season:
Retrospectives performed by the PM team
GSE check-ins with coordinators and core contributors
Reporting of key project and guild metrics and KPIs in the Gearing Up newsletter
Yes to a four-month season
No to a four-month season

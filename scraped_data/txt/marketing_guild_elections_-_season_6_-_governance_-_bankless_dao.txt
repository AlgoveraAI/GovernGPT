Election 3/12 - Governance & Treasury Coordinator
As Mr. V needs to free up some time he suggested splitting the role into two parts (Governance and Treasury) and also splitting the salary. Mr. V would remain the treasury coordinator and hand over the governance responsibility to Sandeepdas.
Candidate: sandeepdas#2062
I am going to move out of my role as the LinkedIn Specialist for bDAO at the end of Season 5. One of my primary reasons for stepping down, in spite of the success of LinkedIn in S5 and its‚Äô importance going forward, is because it always felt as a part of the whole pie (but unable to influence and shape anything for the Marketing Guild). I have been involved in the Governance of the MG unofficially through my feedback and contributions to the MG Constitution in S4 and S5. The Governance aspect is a critical component of a Guild‚Äôs success. If I am elected, I would like to make Governance a fundamental part of how the Guild operates on a day-to-day basis, and also around the important functional and budgetary decisions it takes. Effective governance ensures free and fairer participation, the right level of incentives for the right skill sets, driving home the impact of strategic initiatives, and having more impact from the funding we receive each season. My governance vision, in addition to realizing the above objectives, will also frame how the MG should create its own distinct identity, create a center of excellence, and strengthen bDAO‚Äôs image and perception as the biggest media DAO.
Candidate: Mr. V | mariokondo.eth#2771
As current Governance and Treasury Role Holder since season 3, I intend to serve the guild moving forward. However, my time does not allow for this role fully so I suggested splitting the responsibility and not running for governance. This way I can focus on continuing timely payouts and guild remuneration while the governance coordinator can focus the time on improving the framework.

Candidate: Quilia (she/her)#5170

I started off my bDAO journey by applying for bounties and designing social media posts. I am actively involved with Events. I have worked as a Campaign lead for a couple of projects like Hashkey, bDAO survey in the last 2 seasons. It has been solid 5 months for me in bDAO, working on projects where I could contribute & fits in my marketing arena. I have actively volunteered for projects that required my help & contribution in any possible way. If get selected, I know that I have big shoes to fill in so I‚Äôd appreciate help from International & other frens/Guild members.
Candidate: mimiz#0001
Marketing was my major and I was working for the largest PR company in China and I always find it fascinating. I would say there‚Äôs much more opportunities here in web3 by redefining the 4Cs, build a recommendation system that user have better control. It‚Äôs my first day in bDAO and I would love to start from a simple role that can help me understand how a DAO level marketing strategy would be like. I can help with project planning and strategy designs. I can help with marketing on LinkedIn(I worked for couple months there) and write content in Chinese so bDAO would have a better reach within Chinese audiences. In terms of marketing campaign, I can help support internal coordination of daily communication with clients, project execution and other work matters. https://www.linkedin.com/in/liangzhi-lz-chen-96b815160/ 1

Election 5/12 - Social Media Coordinator
Candidate: Eren Targüè¥#5275
I have been the social media coordinator for 2 seasons and have successfully built up the content pipeline with the help of the SM team. The social media analytics project. Have plans to add social media paid promotions to campaigns in the future and much more.
Candidate: taylans.ethüè¥#2408
I consider this role as the ‚Äúhub‚Äù for all media channels of bDAO. All the media content we produce (bDAO+Projects) flows through these channels to the audience, therefore making it the best point to ‚Äúmeasure the flow rate of running water‚Äù. And I love to take care of these things when it comes to budgeting performance review Discord

Election 6/12 - Content Manager
Candidate: AhinoK#1800
As this new role set in S5 and I have been standing in the role through all S5, everything started from 0, and building to 0.3 (I think) through all this S5, we
created sustainable and healthy bounty task flow
building templates for various media assets
setting the work flow for content creation
gathering and sorting out content pipeline and content calendar
connecting different guilds and projects for content input
trying our best to well allocate various talents (design, copy writing and video editing, etc) for different tasks/opportunities
These are what we have been building through S5, not perfect but trying to settle things.And loads of efforts have been spent on coordination, documentation and communication. It‚Äôs never been easy as I expected in S4, but it worths. It‚Äôs challenging and totally fresh experience for me to work as a role in DAO. But I do hope I can continue this, to carry this uneasy ‚Äú0.3‚Äù to ‚Äú0.6‚Äù even the perfect ‚Äú1‚Äù or more.Here is the outlook I will strive for:
Content work-flow: A settled sorted pipeline and calendar with good clarity for everyone in mkt guild and for who would love to collaborate with mkt guild
Documentation: A good documentation system for content creation and feedback to related content.
Content Creation: get the efficient way to create content(particularly the video content), and leverage content to help the growth on TikTok, Instagram, Facebook and Telegram, even expand more media outlet like gm.xyz, etc.
Find out if there is any possibilities to package the content as a product to satisfy clients/partners, even sell as the service to various campaigns.
Plug-in Talent: Collaborate with talent coordinator, attract more talents to build and make ppl here enjoy building with mkt guild.
Have been learning a lot from teams and pals in mkt guild. And hope we can together go stronger and enjoy building. Discord
Candidate: taylans.ethüè¥#2408

Election 10/12 - Micro Role ‚ÄúTikTok Specialist‚Äù
Candidate: ANDY Banklesslv#8954
Little background about my contributions and work. Started contributing to the DAO in s2. Since then, I have done a fair bit of work in the marketing guild by filming for TikTok (i do the talking in every video) and design work for the design guild and bankless card. Looking at the current state of our TikTok, I think its no where near the same quality as it was before I left the role. I want to take over this role, because I fully believe that I can bring back the s2-s3 quality and views to the current content. For example, the videos I make with Rony get 350-1500 views, while the latest content gets only around 40-180 views. I think its time for a change of the role holder.

Background
The Coordinape is a reward system used by the DAO to distribute 4.5M BANK a season to active contributors. Contributors sign up for the coordinape round monthly and allocate GIVE to their fellow contributors. The purpose of coordinape is to pay contributors for their labor from the prior month. To put it another way, the purpose of coordinape is to inspire contributors to participate more.
The Problems
Members of the DAO that do not actively contribute to the development and sustenance of the DAO are getting more remuneration in coordinape than members who are actively contributing and building.
Suggested Solution
The Discord handles, membership status, and wallet addresses of the active members should be submitted by the coordinators and project managers of the different guilds, departments, and projects of the DAO for the DAO-wide coordinape rounds instead of using the general sign-up forms.
The Benefits
This will ensure that BANK gets into the hands of those who have enough skin in the game.
This will ensure that active contributors are well remunerated.
This will encourage more members to actively contribute to the development and sustenance of the DAO.
This will reduce gaming of coordinape by non-active members who see coordinape as a means of getting free payment for doing nothing.
This will improve engagement in DAO activities.
Action Points
Get a list of all the active projects in the DAO.
Work with the coordinape workstream of the Ops guild to see if implementation is possible.
Obtain agreement via a forum post, and if we do, submit it to Snapshot.
Implement the proposal for the next coordinape round.

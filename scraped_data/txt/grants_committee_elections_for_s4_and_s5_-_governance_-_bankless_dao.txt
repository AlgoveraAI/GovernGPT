According to the Season 1 spec, there will be three seats open for the next Grants Committee for the next term ( that is for Season 4 and Season 5).
The Grants Committee consists of 5-7 members along with a multisig with all committee members as signers.
The Committee is responsible and accountable for managing the grants system, reviewing grant applications, and managing the grants treasury, with the help of other guilds as needed (e.g., treasury).
The Committee has a quorum with four members over seven OR three members over five, but is otherwise responsible for their own operations.
The Committee cannot change the application process to be a committee member without a snapshot vote and is encouraged to accept the DAOâ€™s proposal template.
The Grants Committee is required to be transparent and communicative with the DAO, such as access to Committee meetings and an opportunity to voice opinions and feedback.

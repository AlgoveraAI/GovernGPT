Title: bDIP-03: Dynamic forum quorum for bDIPs
Draft Author: jengajojo
BDIP SUMMARY
The static forum quorum requirements set in the constitution do not reflect the activity of active contributors in the DAO which consequently leads to governance frustration. Instead, the suggestion is to adopt a formula based approach which can evolve as the activity in the DAO evolves.
BDIP BACKGROUND
Recently we saw in bDIP-02: Coordinated timings across bDAO 1 that in times when there are less active contributors, it was really difficult to reach quorum for something relatively simple. The quorum thresholds were defined in the constitution in a time when there were many more active contributors. The challenge with a static threshold is that it cannot reflect the number of active contributors in the DAO at any given time, this is especially relevant for an industry such as crypto where the attention can vary significantly between the bull and the bear phases.
BDIP SPECIFICATION
How can we address this challenge?
Option A: Update thresholds at regular intervals
This option allows contributors to suggest new thresholds based on manually sensing activity in the DAO. The con is the bDIP needs to reach a threshold each time for an update and there may be several updates required each year which costs a lot of admin overhead. Hence I do not recommend this option
Option B: Update thresholds based on formula
This option requires less changes as compared to option A if the formula allows for thresholds to be set dynamically based on activity within the DAO. Overall this reduces the admin overhead.
Current Form
Governance update Forum quorum Approval % Timeline
Major 63 70% 1 week
Minor 51 70% 1 week
Patch 40 70% 1 week
Proposal
Modify the quorum table
Governance update Forum quorum Approval % Timeline
Major 30 Day Average + (0.2 x 30 Day Average) 70% 1 week
Minor 30 Day Average 70% 1 week
Patch 30 Day Average - (0.2 x 30 Day Average) 70% 1 week
Add the following items are criteria for the above in the constitution
- The dataset for 30D avg starts 1 day prior to the date of posting a proposal.
- All forum quorum calculations are rounded to the nearest whole number
- Only polls which have been live for atleast 7 days should be taken into account
- If a forum post includes more than one poll, each poll should be considered a separate datapoint
- 30D Average formula = Sum of votes / number of independent polls
Modify the bDIP proposal template and add the following:
Date posted Post title #votes
ddmmyyyy Title n
Title Value
Major m + (0.2 x m)
Minor m = 30D avg
Patch m - (0.2 x m)
EXPECTED IMPACT
Makes forum quorum more dynamic and reflective of the latest activity in the DAO

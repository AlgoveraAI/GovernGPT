How BanklessDAO Can Capitalize on the Guest Pass without compromising our valuesâ€¦
[This is meant to be an open discussion until there is enough discourse to build a full proposal]
Current Problem:
A large part of the value our social DAO brings is the ability to participate in the discord and our current guest pass system is is infinitely renewable leading to a lack of value capture and retention.
Summary
This discussion is meant for a new system for monetizing our guest pass without limiting access to our organization
A No Loss Subscription 3 is the ability for a potential new member to stake tokens in order to receive a guest pass NFT while allowing the DAO to perform safe yield farming strategies to monetize the staked tokens
Members will have the ability to redeem 100% of their stake while being able to participate in the BanklessDAO discord
The DAO treasury guild will be able to monetize members that are just exploring the DAO
Using this basic model 3 we can extract some takeaways
With the assumption of only 500 guest passes we could expect a yearly revenue of around $2,250
While this is not a lot of money now, this proposal is following the assumption that either the DAO scales or we choose to scale this as a fiscal policy for our full time members
Should we continue to explore this solution?

Welcome to the Marketing Guild Role Holder Election for Season 5. We received 21 applications from Marketing Guild members for the available 12 available roles. The last elections (Season 4) were set up via seshbot on Discord but we want to have more overview, more structure, and give you more details of the applicants and their vision to make better decisions for the selection of the role holders.
Election Process
The Marketing Guild elections for season 5 rely on the governance framework called the Marketing Guild Constitution that was introduced in season 4. All details can be found under Chapter 5 - Elections 4. Let‚Äôs quickly highlight the most important parts for this election:
Timeline: The elections will be open until July 21st 4PM UTC
If there was only one application for a role, there is still a Yes/No Vote to get consensus. There won‚Äôt be an automatic winner just because there was no competition
If there are more than two applications per role, a two-ballot system will be used: If there are more than two options available, two ballots will be needed: The first to decide the two candidates moving to a follow-up Head-to-Head Vote that will be open for another 7 days (until July 28th)

Being a Talent Coordinator for the past two seasons and an active participant in coordinating the guild in different areas has helped me understand how the guild works and how we can best provide value to the growth of the DAO. Our team is an excellent one, and I envision that if we keep building together in this way, we‚Äôre on our way to an excellent Season 5, thanks to everyone‚Äôs hard and mindful work. As Guild Coordinator, I‚Äôm confident I can genuinely provide helpful insights and guidance to anyone who needs it so they can thrive in the guild.

Election 3/12 - Governance & Treasury Coordinator
Candidate: Mr. V | Bankless DAO#2771
I am the current governance & treasury coordinator for season 4 and L2 Member of the bDAO. I would like to continue my service in this area for the guild for season 5. What I did so far: I was responsible for introducing DeWork as a bounty platform, wrote budget proposals S04 and S05, and wrote the Marketing Guild Constitution that recently passed the vote. Besides that, I am contributing to writing long-form Twitter threads and helping shape the marketing strategy overall. Additionally, my background as a digital marketeer in web2 was useful to write proposals for external clients (argent, hDAO, etc.) The goal for season 5 is to support members in formulating proposals and improving our bounty workflow to enable more output. In addition to that, I want to focus on building a reputation system that should help to deploy the best talent possible for a given campaign. I would be honored if you vote me into the role again One Team, One Love

As Guild Coordinator for 3 seasons, and an original member of bDAO from the airdrop over 1 year ago, I‚Äôve learned a lot about web3, cryptocurrencies, NFT projects, and DeFi protocols. Last season I shared the Campaign Coordinator Role, and was the lead on most incoming calls with potential clients such as Openblox, Parcel, Gitcoin, Banklesscard, and others. As CC I plan to do due diligence on all clients to keep the level of bDAO clients high, guide the campaign leads through the creation of proposals, and close deals bringing revenue to the DAO in this bear market. Thank you.

Candidate: Crownüè¥#6220
Hi, I‚Äôd like to reapply for the TikTok specialist role for S5 because I believe there‚Äôs still more to do in growing the DAO‚Äôs TikTok account, although there was hitches in getting consistent content for the TikTok, was able to get around 100 new followers during S4 through constant interaction with other accounts on the app. Over time, I‚Äôve also learnt about new stuff that can help with growing the account and hope to keep learning. And I believe in S5 when there‚Äôs proper flow of content, the account will even grow faster. Below is the link to the account. Link to previous work: TikTok

Election 12/12 - Micro Role ‚ÄúLinkedIn Specialist‚Äù
Candidate: sandeepdas#2062
LinkedIn is going to be an important platform for bDAO going forward (if it is not already). My aim is to make bDAO‚Äôs LinkedIn page a core component of our broader social media and content strategy. The potential that we can leverage from LinkedIn is immense, and we are not anyways close to making good use of it. LinkedIn can act as bDAO‚Äôs platform for thought leadership dissemination, a biz dev channel to attract more clients (we are the biggest media DAO), and also raise visibility and awareness of the Bankless movement. Last but not the least, the bDAO LinkedIn page can act as a magnifier of the Bankless HQ work, and allow us to work in tandem and more in sync. My vision is to increase follower counts to a significant number of hundreds over a period of time, and make LinkedIn an important part of cross-channel campaigns (both internal and external). I also want to expand LinkedIn‚Äôs impact by collaborating with bDAO regional / country nodes who have their own LinkedIn pages. I have already contributed significantly to shape the thinking around LinkedIn by writing and submitting a whole LinkedIn strategy document to the Marketing Guild, which was appreciated. I have been constantly suggesting ideas to strengthen our LinkedIn presence and generate more engagement from MG members (through content creation, engagement etc.). In my personal life, I manage my own LinkedIn account, which is an important platform for me as an independent consultant.

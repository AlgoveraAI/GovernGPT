Translators Guild has a budget of 75,000 BANK and a bounty budget of 34,000 BANK for season 3.
While discussing the funding for the proposed POG-project, questions were raised on
How much of the overall project budget can be allocated to a single project to still leave sufficient funding for future projects and
If the bounty budget could be utilized for early project tasks.
Proposed by Translators Guild Coordinator Grendel and discussed during the weekly guild call on January 27th, 2022 a consensus seemed to be reached that there should be a maximum of 15% to 33% of there overall budget for single projects.
The maximum of 33% (1/3) derived from the idea of splitting the seasonal budget into 3 parts (one for each month) which could be claimable by a project if it is the only project in a given month that asks for funding.
As a second part it should be decided if the bounty budget could be utilized by projects or not.
To open the discussion:
Should there be a funding limit for a single project and if so how high should that be?
Should the bounty budget be utilized to support project related roles/task in the early stages? If so what should be the maximum amount for a bounty?

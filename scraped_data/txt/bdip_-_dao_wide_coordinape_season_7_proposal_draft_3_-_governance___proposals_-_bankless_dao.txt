Author - Infinitehomie.eth
Date - Jan 3, 2023
Scope - Minor Patch
Involved - Ops Department
Summary:
This Draft involves the final decision on what is needed for the Season 7 DAO Wide Coordinape process.
We are looking to decide whether to Pause the Season 7 DAO Wide Coordinape, or whether we need to lower the total BANK Allocation Amount for the DAO Wide Coordinape to 500,000 BANK.
Background
Please refer to Draft 1, and Draft 2 for more background on this situation. I have attached the two previous drafts to this proposal. From the previous proposal, it has been shown that we do need to enact a change to Season 7â€™s DAO Wide Coordinape. It has been voted in Draft 2.

DAO Wide Coordinape Pause Proposal Draft 1 - Governance - Bankless DAO 6
This is due to alleged misbehavior with respect to the Season 6 Period 2 DAO-Wide Coordinape (also known as Season 6 Period 1 due to issues with the Season 6 Period DAO-Wide Coordinape) See those Conversations here (NOTE: This proposal will hereafter be known as the December DAO-Wide Coordinape) -

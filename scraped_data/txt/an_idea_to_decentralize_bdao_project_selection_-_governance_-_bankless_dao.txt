This idea came to me while working on a strategy to decentralize a POS chain.
This conversation is to take a temperature check on what other bDAO members think.
It’s rather simple.
Have project proposers score themselves.
The process would like the DAO will set a fixed periodic project intake date ie Feb1,May 1st, etc.
On the project selection date, the project proposers form the selection committee that will prioritize the projects. Each proposer will score competing projects, but not their own.
The scoring process is moderated by a neutral coordinator.
The scores are tabulated, and project priority is established.
Bounty: scoring coordinator X times per year
Bounty: To make the initial project scorecard, collect the feedback after scoring, and review or update the scorecard as needed x times per year.
Done.
In the longer term, once proven, this could be automated with no coordinator.
To be clear, this idea addresses how to prioritize bDAO projects.
How to determine funding levels and funding allocation would be a different mechanism.
Let’s ideate on the funding step.
Wah say U?

I have been in the marketing guild(now marketing department) since the last season and Iâ€™ve carefully taken time to understand the workflow of how content is generated, published and coordinated, having partaken in certain tasks myself. This new season, I believe I can drive the Content department of the MD forward and raise the level of activity for content creation. I aim to:
. Ensure a seamless and timely flow of tasks from creation to approval.
. Make room for diverse contents thatâ€™ll cover more areas than the ones already in operation.
. Increase the activity rate of people for making excellent content in the marketing department.

Let’s dig in🍴
Even though the DAO has fully integrated Departments as one of its organizational units. The Constitution is yet to be updated to reflect this structural change. Let’s get Departments into the Constitution. Shall we?
BDIP BACKGROUND
Departments are new organizational units of the DAO. They were implement just before the community ratified the BanklessDAO/bankless-dao-constitution 1 . The constitution has not been updated to reflect their existence yet. Departments first appeared here An Idea For Team Taxonomy aka WTF is a Guild? - Governance - Bankless DAO 2 . The
idea of departments gradually gained community consensus and finally got implemented in season 6.
BDIP SPECIFICATION

Current form

Proposal
Definition of Department 
Departments are operation-critical units of BanklessDAO. The qualification test for a department is that if it does not exist, the DAO cannot function properly or may cease to exist! 

Formation of New Department
Departments exist to ensure the functioning and operational needs of the DAO. A new department may be formed if it has been sufficiently determined that the going concern of the DAO is threatened without the existence of this new Department. For a new Department to be formed, the following conditions must be taken into account:
1. The new department cannot be a workstream under or part of an existing department Consider: The new Department should be separate from any existing guilds/Departments.
2. Must clearly satisfy the definition of a Department: Departments are operation-critical units of BanklessDAO.

Formation procedure 
Go through standard DAO governance processes(Soft consensus >formal proposal>snapshot)

1.Discuss and get consensus from the community.
2.Present proposal on the forum for further community discussion and consensus. Use the Department proposal template provided by the DAO. 
3. Head over to GC to justify funding requirements.
4. Proposal must go through snapshot for final consensus.

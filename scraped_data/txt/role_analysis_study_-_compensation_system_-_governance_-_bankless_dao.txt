SUMMARY
I’m brining a post from #dao-general to forums to support information distribution.
I’m currently advising Xiaowen Chen (PhD), Assistant Professor in Industrial/Organizational Psychology & Director of Big Data Lab for Organizational Effectiveness from the university of kentucky 3 and her master students in the process of conducting a role analysis project for BanklessDAO. What we’re aiming toward is the development of a qualification and necessity framework for roles to be prioritized in terms of compensation. The role holder analysis study is a specific branch of the main compensation system.

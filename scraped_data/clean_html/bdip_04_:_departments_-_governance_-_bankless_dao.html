<a name="bdip-background-2" ></a>BDIP BACKGROUND</h1>
<p>Departments are new organizational units of the DAO. They were implement just before the community ratified the <a >BanklessDAO/bankless-dao-constitution <span >1</span></a> . The constitution has not been updated to reflect their existence yet. Departments first appeared here <a >An Idea For Team Taxonomy aka WTF is a Guild? - Governance - Bankless DAO <span >2</span></a> . The<br>
idea of departments gradually gained community consensus and finally got implemented in season 6.</p>

<p><strong>Further Details</strong></p>
<p>Definition of Department</p>
<p>Departments are operation-critical units of BanklessDAO. The qualification test for a department is that if it does not exist, the DAO cannot function properly or may cease to exist! <a >An Idea For Team Taxonomy aka WTF is a Guild? - Governance - Bankless DAO <span >2</span></a></p>
<p>Formation of Departments</p>
<p>Departments exist to ensure the functioning and operational needs of the DAO. A new department may be formed if it has been sufficiently determined that the going concern of the DAO is threatened without the existence of this new Department. For a new Department to be formed, the following conditions must be taken into account:</p>
<ol>
<li>The new department cannot be a workstream under or part of an existing department Consider: The new Department should be separate from any existing guilds/Departments.</li>
<li>Must clearly satisfy the definition of a Department: Departments are operation-critical units of BanklessDAO.</li>
</ol>
<p>Formation procedure - Go through standard DAO governance processes!</p>
<p>TLDR</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Discuss and get consensus from the community.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Present proposal on forum for further community discussion and consensus. Use the Department proposal template - <a >Department Funding Template - Grants/Funding - Bankless DAO <span >3</span></a></p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Head over to GC to justify funding requirements.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Send proposal to snapshot for final consensus.</p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Soft Consensus</li>
</ul>
<p>Initial and thorough discussions within the community to gauge support and general alignment. Discussion may happen within various guilds/departments and on CC. During this stage, the individual/workgroup proposing the creation of the new department may work closely with the OPs department to ensure alignment and ensure that there are no workstreams working on the same or a similar thing.</p>
<ul>
<li>Formal proposal</li>
</ul>
<p>If the community has a template for departments proposal, use template to draft a forum proposal for the creation of the new department.</p>
<ul>
<li>Snapshot</li>
</ul>
<p>Proposal moves to snapshot for voting.</p>

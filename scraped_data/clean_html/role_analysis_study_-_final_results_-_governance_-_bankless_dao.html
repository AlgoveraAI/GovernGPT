<a name="summary-1" ></a>SUMMARY</h1>
<ul>
<li>The Role Analysis Study was a project conducted from November to December of 2022.</li>
<li>This post is to outline the ‘raw outputs’ as points of reference.</li>
<li>This research is going to help inform the Qualification &amp; Necessity matrices which are elements of the compensation system revamp plan. The plan will be submitted as a DRAFT here on forums for community-revision later. The compensation system innovation procurement shall continue to be hosted under something similar to a governance body (department) of BanklessDAO, with an elected/appointed workstream/project lead and a support (buddy-system). That’s ultimately for the body to decide.</li>
</ul>

<a name="background-2" ></a>BACKGROUND</h1>
<p>In late Q4 of 2022 a group of masters students from the University of Kentucky conducted a Role Analysis Study on behalf of BanklessDAO, which was funded by <a >@saulthorin</a>, former GSE and founder of talentDAO. The Studys’ purpose was to get the data that is required to establish Qualification &amp; Necessity Score, one of several elements in the compensation system. Read my post from November for more <a >context <span >1</span></a>.</p>

<a name="details-3" ></a>DETAILS</h1>
<p>The final presentation has been recorded and the file is enclosed. The study provides us with insights and a better understanding of the guild- &amp; governance-coordinator role. The information shall help us design the compensation system in consequence.</p>

</ul>
<p>BanklessDAO now has a contact at the University of Kentucky, Xiaowen Chen (PhD), <a >Assistant Professor in Industrial/Organizational Psychology &amp; Director of Big Data Lab for Organizational Effectiveness <span >1</span></a>. She and her master students are open to an ongoing relationship with BanklessDAO through the establishment of a standard procedure of role analysis within our organisation.</p>
<p>They could further analyse each role (in relationship to other roles) for a more holistic view of our compensation structure. This is a time consuming endeavour and pretty much TBD.</p>

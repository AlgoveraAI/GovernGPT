<p>My Discord: edamame#0001</p>
<p>If you could please fill out this form about your opinion of the discord as of right now that would help a lot. <a >https://forms.gle/QSijn991FNmH4FhH7 <span >13</span></a></p>
<p><strong>Summary</strong><br>
During my time at BanklessDAO I have noticed a lot of things about the Discord. For one the guest pass system is incredibly inefficient and can be easily reworked. I have also noticed that in order to get Level 1 2 or 3 status you have to have a certain amount of Bank. This might not be an option for individuals that don’t have as much money to spend on the project.</p>
<p><strong>Proposal</strong><br>
What I am proposing is that in addition to Level 1, 2 and 3 tiers we also add a role that indicates how long someone has been in the server. This would just show that we appreciate our members who have been in discord for a while. This role would not give any benefits,it would simply be a way to recognize people who have been in the discord for a significant amount of time. As for the guest pass system. I propose setting up a ticket bot (tickettool.xyz) where new members can make a ticket to get the guest pass so that it is easier for people to give new members a guest pass. I have noticed it is quite hard for Level 2 members to locate people who need a guest pass. This system would sort all individuals who need a guest pass into one easily locatable section.</p>
<p><strong>Channel Permissions</strong><br>
In addition to this I have also noticed that members can view every guild’s channels . What I propose is that only people with a certain role can view the channel. When you react in <span >#role-select</span> you are given the role of whatever you select. Making the guild channels only visible to people who have the designated role would help clear up the discord and overall tidy everything up. Members do not need to be able to see guilds or projects they are not involved in. This is very easy to set up and can be done with the change of one setting under each channel’s configuration.</p>
<p><strong>Guest Passes:</strong><br>
Just a little bit more about the guest pass system that I am proposing. How the ticket bot works is that we create a channel called “Guest Pass Application” . In said channel anyone who wants the guest pass can write whatever they want. All these applications are automatically sorted under one section where they are easy to find. While configuring the bot you can set what roles have access to view the tickets. From there when free Level 2 members can go in and if they feel that it is right give the applicant the guest pass they were in search off. This process is the same for guest pass renewing. After the role is assigned the members that are allowed to view the tickets can close the ticket and delete them. This prevents confusion when trying to get a guest pass. I am quite familiar with the ticket bot and it is an excellent and easy to use tool. I can provide tickettool training for anyone who needs it if this is in fact implemented.</p>

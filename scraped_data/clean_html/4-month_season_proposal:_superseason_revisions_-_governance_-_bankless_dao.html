<p>This is an edit of the <a >Super Season <span >5</span></a> proposal to make a four-month season for Season 4 rather than a three or six-month season. Based on discussions in the <span >#seasons</span> channel and feedback from many contributors, a four-month season (16-weeks) seems to be a happy medium.</p>
<h2>
<a name="the-schedule-of-a-16-week-season-would-be-1" ></a>The schedule of a 16-week season would be:</h2>
<p>Break week: April 4-8</p>
<p><strong>Season 4 Start: April 18</strong></p>
<p>Founding Day/One Year Anniversary: May 4</p>
<p>Permissionless: May 17-19</p>
<p>Break Week: August 8-12</p>
<p><strong>Season 5 Start: August 15-19</strong></p>
<p>For reasoning on why Iâ€™m proposing a longer season, I refer you to the original <a >Super Season <span >5</span></a> post.</p>

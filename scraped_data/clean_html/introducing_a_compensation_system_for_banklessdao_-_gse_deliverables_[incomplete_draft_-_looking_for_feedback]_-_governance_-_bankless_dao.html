<h1>
<a name="summary-2" ></a>SUMMARY</h1>
<p>The GSE program was mandated to engage in an analysis of potential methodologies to be used for compensation to improve how budget strategy and resource distribution operates within the DAO. We seek to propose a new model that accounts for contextualised contribution by BanklessDAO members while maintaining an easy-to-admin interface for Guilds, Departments, Projects, and the DAO.</p>
<h1>
<a name="background-3" ></a>BACKGROUND</h1>
<p>We approached this big topic by estimating the current complications within the DAO, things that happen to influence the compensation system in a bad way or are symptoms of/by-products of the current compensation standards. Then we formulated guiding principles on which our approach and proposed solutions are based upon.</p>
<h4>
<a name="current-complications-4" ></a>Current Complications</h4>
<ul>
<li>Lack of distinction between public goods vs revenue generating projects. We fund everything the same.</li>
<li>No clear classification or progression levels for work roles</li>
<li>Lack of clear definition of what a contributor actually is</li>
<li>Clarity on expectations and responsibilities of, and by contributors</li>
<li>Market volatility in compensation plans utilising a native asset but calculated with external asset valuations</li>
</ul>
<h4>
<a name="determining-questions-5" ></a>Determining Questions</h4>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>Reward Principles:</strong> What’s the north star?</li>
<li>
<strong>Reward Eligibility:</strong> Who should we reward?</li>
<li>
<strong>Reward Structure:</strong> What should we reward, under what terms?</li>
<li>
<strong>Reward Amount:</strong> How much should we reward?</li>
<li>
<strong>Reward Consensus:</strong> How do we agree on the reward?</li>
</ul>

<p> → Economic Policy to apply mechanism to funding pools</p>
<h3>
<a name="economic-policy-10-current-state-of-compensation-11" ></a>Economic Policy 1.0 - Current State of compensation</h3>
<ol>
<li>Maximum funding request of 1,000 BANK/hr</li>
</ol>
<p>GC Guideline of 1k Bank/Hour with occasional local deviation on a case by case basis.<br>
Monthly Coordinape rounds with multipliers for each contributor level.</p>
<ol start="2">
<li>GC authorises funding for Guilds/Projects/Department</li>
</ol>
<p>The seasonal specification sets a maximum budget for guilds, departments &amp; projects. Prior to each season ending, the spec is being ratified on snapshot and enforced by the community.</p>
<ol start="3">
<li>Guilds/Departments/Project authorise funding for working groups</li>
<li>Coordinape is 1.5M/month = 4.5M/season</li>
</ol>
<p>This approach has manifested several classic problems, including values of labor that vary with market conditions, non-competitive earning rates, and lack of compensation elasticity at scale. Discrepancies between pool sizes results in drastic imbalances of allocation compared to contributions, leading to misaligned incentives around participation. <a >The community debates <span >1</span></a> about reducing the amount allocated to Coordinape next season already. <a >I expressed my concerns</a> with Coordinape too and tried to draw a path forward.</p>
<p>In compensating with our native asset, we are forced to use methods that overlap with traditional equity standards due to natural limits on the system, which this <a >article</a> maps rather succinctly.</p>
<p>In calibrating the development of a compensation framework, the approach we will be taking is in relation to the percentage of tokens, following the rationale of the author:</p>
<p>“Although this approach takes the most preparation, it’s also the only one that, in the authors’ opinion, accounts for market volatility and mitigates employee pay inequity, while minimizing unnecessary token dilution and preserving an employee’s asymmetric upside.”</p>
<p>Our revenue model is also impactful on our compensation system in that most revenues generated by projects dispersal happens locally, and only a small margin of surplus is passed on to the DAO. This means that self-sufficiency is expected of most areas of the DAO, and a large total surplus is necessary to fund internal operations that are cost centers by nature.</p>

<h3>
<a name="organizational-compensation-dependencies-14" ></a>Organizational Compensation Dependencies</h3>
<ul>
<li>Treasury emissions</li>
<li>Token price</li>
</ul>
<p>We created a formula to balance the compensation dependencies for individuals and the organization. It allows us to transform the BANK emissions system from an equality-focused system of 1000 BANK/hr to each contributor to an equity-focused system → accounting for individual differences in contributor dependencies.</p>
<p>This system allows for modular flexibility, experimentation, and autonomy at the guild/subDAO level for later incorporation at the DAO level, if desired.</p>

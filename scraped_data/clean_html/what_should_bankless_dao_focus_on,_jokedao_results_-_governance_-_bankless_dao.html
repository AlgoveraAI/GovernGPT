Bankless DAO wants to focus on… Tokenomics!<br>
The most important suggestion presented by raybankless.eth and voted on by 25 persons with a total weight of 27% of all votes was this (summary from datadump):</p>
<p><strong>We should focus on utilizing BANK. Give it a usage to decrease the sell pressure on it</strong></p>
<p>So the Bankless Tokenomics department is a DAO wide priority!</p>
<p>The top five priorities illustrated below:</p>

<p><strong>Participation</strong><br>
a total of 110 wallets voted on jokedao, significantly lower than our hopes but still a decent figure!<br>
No proposal had an super committed crowd putting 100% on it in general, most people voted for more than one proposal.</p>
<p>To continue this with the next step, <strong>our partners at Polygon DAO will airdrop matic tokens to everyone that voted</strong> with an extra allocation to Ray for the winning proposal. The purpose here, which will be reflected in the value is to cover gas for this and a few more contests. (of course no cost to Bankless DAO)</p>
<p><strong>Reflections</strong><br>
Some personal reflections from my end here, this should not be seen as something conclusive but rather food for thought.</p>
<p><strong>Did we as a DAO lose focus on our mission and our community?</strong><br>
Apart from maybe the media house proposal, very few of the suggestions would focus on onboarding the next billion users into crypto. Most of them touch on tokenomics or remuneration, maybe project funding. All important areas, but for me, while governance and tokenomics is important for our longevity they won’t help the DAO survive if we’re not aligned on the purpose. We can set great governance and funding terms but without clear direction how can we fund the most important projects?</p>
<p>There is a clear risk, to me, that Bankless DAO becomes a web3 incubator for projects looking for funding and while they may be great, they don’t result in any new people finding web3. I fear that this path would be very hard to turn back from once started. We already have a lot of different projects.</p>
<p>We see the bear market impacting our USD term payments for work in BanklessDAO, and this is hard, how can we sustain our new contributors if we can’t pay decent level of compensation. I get it and its important that the token represent more than membership, and it might be even more important to figure out how the kick-back from the great projects using our brand can be used to offset BANK only compensation.</p>
<p><strong>Next steps</strong><br>
The next jokedao race, which will be initiated with an airdrop during the coming weeks. I suggest we will explore the utility of BANK to reduce seller as the DAO indicated the importance of this. After this vote I will suggest we break-down the GSE list to see where the DAO wants to focus more.</p>
<p>Feedback on this during the week will be very appreciated!</p>

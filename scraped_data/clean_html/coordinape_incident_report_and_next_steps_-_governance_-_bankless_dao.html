<a name="summary-1" ></a>Summary</h2>
<ul>
<li>Former DAO-wide Coordinape Admin, Whales #7970, has admitted to impersonating 2 DAO members in coordinape: Tomahawk#3011 and Shaun/dancingpenguin.eth#2590</li>
<li>During this investigation, it was also discovered that many DAO members had transferred BANK to each others‚Äô wallets to meet the minimum 35K requirement for L1/L2 during signup (i.e. they were not holding 35K BANK)</li>
<li>It was also discovered that many DAO members are allocating GIVE based upon relationships and initiatives OUTSIDE of the DAO (i.e. they were not allocating based upon contribution to BanklessDAO)</li>
<li>Operations Department needs some DAO consensus to continue</li>
</ul>
<h2>
<a name="background-2" ></a>Background</h2>
<p>It was <a >recently discovered</a> that our DAO-wide coordinape admin, Whales #7970, had used his position to steal BANK from BanklessDAO. <a >Whales admitted <span >1</span></a> to impersonating two members of the DAO and allocating himself GIVE. During this investigation, it was also discovered that members were sending each other BANK to hit the L1 requirement to sign up for Coordinape, thus increasing their potential rewards while not holding L1 status. Members were also found to be giving each other GIVE not for contribution to BanklessDAO, but for personal and external business reasons.</p>
<p>The investigation team (infinitehomie.eth #4930, Sprinklesforwinners#1125, links#7868, and LiviuC#7835) <a >brought their findings to the Ops Department</a>. Ops decided not to give a December contributor reward list to the Grants Committee, which means that December Coordinape rewards will NOT be paid out. Ops further decided (<a >with</a> <a >DAO</a> <a >input</a>) to pause the Coordinape workstream until it could be reworked to avoid the issues mentioned above.</p>
<p>There were some issues that Ops Department was not able to decide on its own, as there was consensus that these issue were beyond the Ops Department mandate:</p>
<ul>
<li>Who should decide the consequences for Whales #7970?</li>
<li>What are the consequences for Whales #7970?</li>
<li>How much should the investigation team be compensated for their work?</li>
<li>How much should we fund to fix/replace Coordinape?</li>
</ul>

<a name="consequences-4" ></a>Consequences</h3>
<p>Whales #7970 admitted to using his role to steal BANK. He was <a >removed from his position <span >1</span></a> in the Ops Department. However, Ops Department doesn‚Äôt feel it has the authority to unilaterally decide on DAO-wide consequences for this contributor.</p>

<p>The investigation team (infinitehomie.eth #4930, Sprinklesforwinners#1125, links#7868, and LiviuC#7835) spent significant time (over 70 hours between them, with more to come) to acquire needed data from the blockchain and the coordinape team, pour over all of the transactions to analyze the data, interview contributors to get multiple perspectives, <a >report findings</a>, and gain consensus through forum proposals and sync meetings. How much should they be compensated for their efforts?</p>

<a name="final-thoughts-11" ></a>Final Thoughts</h2>
<p>Although it‚Äôs saddening to hear about a contributor taking advantage of the DAO, it‚Äôs also heartening to see contributors step up to help solve this issue. Thieves won‚Äôt stop BanklessDAO, only contributor apathy can do that.</p>
<p>Let‚Äôs use this situation to become stronger, so BanklessDAO can help bring the Bankless message to the world.</p>

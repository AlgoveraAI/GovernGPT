<h3>
<a name="weav-8" ></a>WEAV</h3>
<p>WEAV is the native governance token of Weavr. The WEAV token is a smart contract registered on the Arbitrum (arb) Ethereum Layer 2 blockchain. It follows the ERC-20 standard and is compatible with majority of wallets and exchanges currently supporting Ethereum-based cryptocurrencies.</p>
<h3>
<a name="needles-9" ></a>Needles</h3>
<p>A component of the Protocol that enables the purchase of an asset by the Governor corporation through crowdfunding as well as conducting movements of capital from the token holders to the Governor corporation. Imagine an individual brought a project idea to our platform to collaborate with others and bring it to reality. Weavr allows them to create a needle proposal with all the details of your idea for other investors to come and co-build. Then Weavr will facilitate the execution of the project to become a thread. A Needle dissolves after transitioning into a Thread.</p>
<h3>
<a name="threads-10" ></a>Threads</h3>
<p>Threads are properties cataloged in our club for which investors can buy fractions starting at $1USDC. A Thread is an on-chain governance system for the Governor corporation that legally owns the Thread property. Thread governance is based on Thread tokens and it is structured as a sub-DAO within the Weavr. Every thread is a DAO itself, a community where all individuals have voice and the right to vote. To ensure the growth on property value, we conduct a KYC/KYB that unlocks token-holders right to vote. All default votes and restrictions are design to comply with law and create a thriving system for the community. The owner of the property will be retaining 40% of their ownership, with voting power capped at 10% per person to provide whale protection.</p>
<h3>
<a name="thread-tokens-11" ></a>Thread tokens</h3>
<p>Thread tokens are ERC-20 tokens created by an indivisible smart contract on the Ethereum blockchain. Since the tokens are indivisible and impossible to replicate, they are the perfect medium for individual intellectual property tracing. These fractional tokens give each holder a percentage of property ownership that can be traded or exchanged on secondary markets.</p>

<a name="background-13" ></a>BACKGROUND</h1>
<p><a >About BanklessDAO<br>
</a>The BanklessDAO is a decentralized autonomous organization that acts as a steward of the Bankless Movement, progressing the world towards a future of greater freedom. BanklessDAO is a community of passionate Web3 thought-leaders who aim to educate new users, produce written and audio media, build DAO tooling, provide research &amp; consulting services, develop Web3 scholarship, and create a social and creative home base for anyone in Web3. BanklessDAO is much more than a social DAO—it’s shipping, building, and innovating DAO.</p>
<p>About WeavrDAO<br>
WeavrDAO is private members club and a decentralised platform for fractional Real Estate ownership. A market where people can participate in tokenized real estate starting at $1. The WeavrDAO operates as a DAO and by being a decentralized organization, the WeavrDAO allows individuals from all over the world to join, participate, and build on top of the organization. There are no geographical or economic entrance barriers to the WeavrDAOs potential to grow.</p>
<h1><a name="h-14" ></a></h1>
<h1>
<a name="mission-values-alignment-15" ></a>MISSION &amp; VALUES ALIGNMENT</h1>
<p>WeavrDAOs’ mission is to bring real estate cash flows and equity appreciation to individuals all over the world. Projects like Bankless Brazil or Bankless Africa could benefit tremendously by getting exposure to real estate that is perhaps not available in their areas or strongly controlled by the government. There is a possibility of a lease to own framework that allows “unbanked” mortgage-like instruments to encourage ownership. WeavrDAO helps the world go more Bankless by offering individuals the opportunity to own an asset that most of us can’t afford without having a bank as middleman - real estate!</p>

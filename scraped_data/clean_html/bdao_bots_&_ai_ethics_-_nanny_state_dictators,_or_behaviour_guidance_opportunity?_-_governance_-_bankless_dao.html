<p>I’m currently serving a 2.5 day ban from bDAO Discord - my mobile says - for sharing a link.</p>
<p>A whole DAO ban, based on sharing in Research Guild.</p>
<p>A question asked in RG was are there any topics for research. SInce I’m researching into WG / Guild / Project / DAO workflows, I wanted to share my recent article, which has been approved for publication by Bankless Publication.</p>
<aside > <header >  <a >Bankless Publishing – 17 Aug 22</a> </header> <article >  <h3><a >Four Factors That Make a DAO Sticky - Bankless Publishing <span >3</span></a></h3> <p>Four key factors DAOs should focus on to boost retention.</p> <p> <span >Est. reading time: 12 minutes</span> </p> </article> </aside> <p>I view this instant ban as needless, crude, detrimental to DAO health, and unjustly exclusionary. I thought DAOs were open door, inclusive, creative kinds of places.</p>
<p>Actually I think bDAO still is a great place, but that this is a crude piece of bot design of the worst order. And I also think bDAO can do better in its bot design. How so?</p>
<p><strong>AI Ethics</strong><br>
This is a hot topic across the digital world, and I’d hope bDAO can show AI Ethics in action.</p>
<p>Surely, making bot design that involves bDAO contributors should have a voting mechanism attached, for the sake of ethics? And that this voting mechanism is made public during bot design and before commissioning any dev work, to better understand “unintended consequences”?</p>
<p><strong>Bot Design</strong><br>
If this design is intended on a per channel / guild basis, then channels / guilds need to opt in, and say they are doing so in their start here channels. Timeouts and bans should not be on a Discord wide basis, and I suggest 2 days or more is a crazy time span unless for persistent offenders, POs. (NB Subsequent discovery, the 2 days is on my mobile, not the desktop!) For POs, I believe Discord itself can ban offenders, and for now that this is a manual last resort. Maybe bot design can handle this, but I refer to my comments above about AI Ethics.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Where is the community learning curve design in the bot design thinking?</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Community Learning Curves</strong><br>
If the Guild wants its community to learn, then have warning stages that the bot operates to.</p>
<ol>
<li>First warning: risk and length of timeout / ban</li>
<li>Final warning: imminent timeout / ban, risk and length</li>
<li>Timeout / ban</li>
</ol>
<p>Overriding ethos: what do warning recipients need to do to avoid timeouts?</p>
<p>This at least incorporates a learning curve, and on a guild by guild, project by project etc. basis</p>
<p>I welcome thoughts and suggestions here, current bot design may make life easier for role holders, but it will dismay genuine contributors and bDAO enthusiasts.</p>
<p>Please indicate your support for this, or list your objections, I’m happy to discuss.</p><section ><nav ></nav></section>

<p>According to the Season 1 spec, there will be three seats open for the next Grants Committee for the next term ( that is for Season 4 and Season 5).</p>
<p>The Grants Committee consists of 5-7 members along with a multisig with all committee members as signers.</p>
<p>The Committee is responsible and accountable for managing the grants system, reviewing grant applications, and managing the grants treasury, with the help of other guilds as needed (e.g., treasury).</p>
<p>The Committee has a quorum with four members over seven OR three members over five, but is otherwise responsible for their own operations.</p>
<p>The Committee cannot change the application process to be a committee member without a snapshot vote and is encouraged to accept the DAOâ€™s proposal template.</p>

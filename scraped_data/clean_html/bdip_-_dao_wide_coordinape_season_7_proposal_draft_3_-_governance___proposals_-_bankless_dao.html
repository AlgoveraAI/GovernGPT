<p>Date - Jan 3, 2023</p>
<p>Scope - Minor Patch</p>
<p>Involved - Ops Department</p>
<p><strong>Summary:</strong></p>
<p>This Draft involves the final decision on what is needed for the Season 7 DAO Wide Coordinape process.</p>
<p>We are looking to decide whether to Pause the Season 7 DAO Wide Coordinape, or whether we need to lower the total BANK Allocation Amount for the DAO Wide Coordinape to 500,000 BANK.</p>
<p><strong>Background</strong></p>
<p>Please refer to Draft 1, and Draft 2 for more background on this situation. I have attached the two previous drafts to this proposal. From the previous proposal, it has been shown that we do need to enact a change to Season 7â€™s DAO Wide Coordinape. It has been voted in Draft 2.</p>

<p><a >DAO Wide Coordinape Pause Proposal Draft 1 - Governance - Bankless DAO <span >6</span></a></p>
<p>This is due to alleged misbehavior with respect to the Season 6 Period 2 DAO-Wide Coordinape (also known as Season 6 Period 1 due to issues with the Season 6 Period DAO-Wide Coordinape) See those Conversations here (NOTE: This proposal will hereafter be known as the December DAO-Wide Coordinape) -</p>
<p><strong>Financial Implications:</strong></p>
<p>If the vote is for a Season 7 Pause of the DAO-Wide Coordinape, 4.5 Million Bank will be saved.</p>
<p>If the vote is for a Season 7 Reduction to a total of 500,000 BANK total per period for the DAO-Wide Coordinape, 3.5 million BANK will be saved.</p>
<p><strong>bDAO Impact:</strong></p>
<p>This is DAO Wide, specifically members who apply for the DAO Wide Coordinape. Season 6 December Period reported approximately 187 Members.</p>

<p><strong>Analysis:</strong></p>
<p>We will provide analysis of the savings for the DAO as a result of Ops and Coordinape Investigation. Current Information can be found in the Coordinape Workstream, and in the Coordinape Investigation Project Thread housed in the Research Guild Workstream.</p>

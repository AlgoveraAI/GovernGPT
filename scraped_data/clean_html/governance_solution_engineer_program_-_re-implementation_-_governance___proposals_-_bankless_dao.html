<p>Alright everyone, the quorum requirement has been removed!</p>
<p>While the GSE has been forum approved, but not snapshot approved, I thought this would be a chance to refresh it in the DAOs memory.</p>
<p>By the time we get this implemented we will have 4 weeks left in the season, which could be a chance to start to get organized and initiate work.</p>
<p>Since the initial snapshot is defunct, and time has passed, we will re-collect applicants through this <a >LINK <span >15</span></a> (<a >Submissions <span >33</span></a>) from .</p>
<p>There was some opinion that we should anonymize submissions. My thoughts are that it is a GOOD thing that people will vote on the policy vs the person.</p>
<p> <strong>Currently submissions are anonymous, but if we vote against it I will de-anonymize them.</strong><br>
Additionally, I will share the submission form with <a >@links</a>, and <a >@jameswmontgomery.eth</a> to hold myself accountable. (and really anyone else that is interested‚Ä¶)</p>

<p>The GSE has been ratified, although because of quorum challenges I wanted to re-reference this and bring it to everyone‚Äôs attention.</p>
<p>The steps forward for the GSE are:</p>
<ol>
<li>Intake applicants for the next 14 Days. ( Till the <strong>11th</strong>)</li>
<li>Once collected, we will kick off a snapshot to approve the GSE program, and elect applicants through token weighted voting.</li>
</ol>

<a name="financial-process-9" ></a><strong>Financial Process:</strong>
</h2>
<ul>
<li>Each Gov SE is guaranteed a 75,000 BANK salary.</li>
<li>At the end of the Season, the DAO will vote on two deliverables produced by the GSEs via forum vote. One for strategic prioritization and one for contributor Alignment. Each deliverable will be rated on a scale of 1 to 5, which will unlock additional compensation.
<ul>
<li>Each deliverable will unlock a maximum of 375K BANK, for a total of 750K.</li>
<li>Each rating will unlock 75K in funding. 1 = 75K, 2 = 150K, 3 = 225K, 4 = 300K, 5 = 375K</li>
<li>Additional compensation is only for GSEs. Distribution will be up to the 5 GSEs. They can choose to use Team Set Salaries or Coordinape.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>The two working groups (Contributor alignment and Strategic Prioritization) will have an allocated budget of 500,000 BANK EACH to collectively decide how to allocate and compensate members of the working group. Gov SEs may not draw from this allocation.</li>
<li>Funds will be held in a multi-sig held by the 5 GSEs
<ul>
<li>Once all compensation has been distributed, GSEs must produce a financial report outlining how funds were distributed.</li>
<li>Any funds not distributed will be returned to the treasury</li>

<h2>
<a name="tldr-1" ></a>TL;DR</h2>
<ul>
<li>This proposal is to initiate a token swap with VitaDAO for its governance token $VITA.</li>
<li>$25,000 worth of BANK will be swapped for $25,000 of VITA taken at the 30-day moving average at the end of the votes on both sides.</li>
<li>BanklessDAO would benefit from treasury diversification and possible sales of its products and services to VitaDAO.</li>
<li>The partnership aligns with BanklessDAO‚Äôs mission and values by promoting decentralized, permissionless, and censorship-resistant technology and community.</li>
</ul>
<h2>
<a name="background-2" ></a>BACKGROUND</h2>
<p>BanklessDAO (referred to as ‚ÄúbDAO‚Äù) is seeking to build relationships with other DAOs and Web3 organizations to 1) diversify its treasury holdings to help the DAO in the long term operational viability; 2) introduce the tools and services developed by bDAO to Web3 communities; 3) raise awareness of bDAO in different communities.</p>
<p>VitaDAO is a community-owned collective funding early-stage longevity research, governed through the <a >VitaDAO Snapshot. <span >7</span></a> VitaDAO is looking to partner with bDAO via token swap to intensify the collaboration and create mutual awareness between the two organizations.</p>
<p>A token swap with VitaDAO will not only diversify bDAO‚Äôs treasury but also help initiate the partnership with VitaDAO, which can provide further opportunities for promoting bDAO‚Äôs products, e.g., DAO dash and DEGEN bot.</p>
<p>About VitaDAO</p>
<p>VitaDAO is an open cooperative that anyone can join, with the goal to acquire, support, and finance new therapeutics and research data in the longevity space. The VitaDAO collective will directly hold legal IP rights to these projects and may develop a growing portfolio of assets represented as IP-NFTs and Tokens.</p>
<p>Members of the public can join VitaDAO and govern its IP through VITA tokens by contributing funds, work, or valuable research data or IP assets. VITA tokens enable their holders to engage in decision-making and governance of VitaDAO‚Äôs research, signal support for specific initiatives, and govern its data repositories and IP portfolio.</p>

<h2>
<a name="mission-and-values-alignment-4" ></a>MISSION AND VALUES ALIGNMENT</h2>
<p>This proposal will initiate the partnership between bDAO and VitaDAO, which aligns with what ‚ÄúGo Bankless‚Äù means: promoting decentralized, permissionless, and censorship-resistant technology and community.</p>
<p>The Bankless meme envisions a world where people use web3/crypto tools to navigate the coordination challenges of the 21st Century. Funding longevity research is currently masked with red tape. If we are able to use web3/crypto tools to unlock new drugs and techniques to reduce the healthcare costs of society as a whole, it gives added validation for using web3/crypto tools to coordinate actions of apes around the world with this Bankless technology and encourages more people to adopt the Bankless lifestyle.</p>

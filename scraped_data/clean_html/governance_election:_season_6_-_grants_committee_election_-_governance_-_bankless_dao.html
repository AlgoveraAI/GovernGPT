<h2>
<a name="infinitehomieeth4930-7" ></a>Infinitehomie.eth#4930</h2>
<p><strong>Reason For Applying:</strong></p>
<p>I believe that Season 6 is a critical season for the future of Bankless DAO, and what that future means for Web3 as a whole.</p>
<p>I believe that I can take a critical eye towards grants going forward in BanklessDAO, while realizing how important diversity is, and will be in revenue generation, and utility for the DAO. It is realized that grants need to be held at a critical standard, considering the current state of BANK in this particular market. I realize, and would like to focus on management of GC Treasury, by way of having a greater focus on which grants continue forward.</p>
<p>I want to make sure that projects are truly going forward on merit, and not simply on name only. There have been many important projects that have made an amazing impact on BanklessDAO, because of the support of Grants Committee. There have also been projects that have not.</p>
<p>I believe I can assist in finding that balance, and being an active, involved, and concerned member of GC.</p>
<p><strong>Qualifications:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>involvement in Treasury Management in Podcast Hatchery, Crypto Sapiens, and Research Guild.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>7 years community banking experience, handling treasury management of various demographics, including experience in developing new strategies for the unbanked, to take control of their situation.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>process development - managed processes for Crypto Sapiens and Research Guild.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>2 years experience in notion management.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>bachelors degree in philosophy. With which I have developed critical thinking skills that have been used to find unique solutions for diverse needs.</p>

<p><strong>Reason for applying</strong></p>
<p>As BanklessDAO experiments with various ways of effectively organizing our community(guilds, department etc). There‚Äôs a continuous challenge of how to effectively deploy funds to keep various initiatives(guilds, projects and now departments) running in a way that is sustainable to bDAO but not stifling to these initiatives.</p>
<p>The Grants Committee is constantly trying to come up with solutions to help deal with some of these challenges. I would passionately love to contribute to the Grants Committee in helping to create and implement solutions to some of these key challenges.</p>
<p><strong>Qualifications</strong></p>
<ul>

<a name="feems4876-11" ></a>Feems#4876</h2>
<p><strong>Reason for applying</strong></p>
<p>Only being in Bankless for a little over half a year I have had the pleasure of working on many projects and guilds (ops, research, AV, Treasury, Bankless Africa, Global events team among other others), so it‚Äôs fair to say that I have put my hand in many of the baskets of this DAO and contributed heavily. Why is this important? well I think in order to accurately asses a project for the benefit of the DAO one must play in the different areas of the organization to understand a holistic perspective of this machine we call Bankless DAO but most importantly the efforts of it‚Äôs members.</p>
<p>My priorities as a grants committee member, if selected will be looking at the following</p>
<ul>
<li>Projects that can sustain themselves and bring back revenue to our treasury</li>
<li>Projects that can assist with our brand awareness and potential conversion of casual members to core members</li>
<li>Projects that have a product market fit that can assist in the valuation of not only our brand but our token.</li>
</ul>
<p>That‚Äôs my priorities - however I think we need to reduce the subjectivity of grant decisions but also allow opportunities for more people to be successful when they submit a proposal. I would also like to spearhead selection criteria for transparent and equitable selection (the same as standard grants do outside of web 3) - with a clear focus on impact, feasibility, costs, measurement criteria and how it relates to the members specified goals in this election (like mine stated above). It reduces the subjectivity and I think having alignment as a committee to what our goals are or providing a clearer measurement tool will allow for a more standardized and equitable decision process.</p>
<p>I also think that it would be very helpful to be specific as to what is missing from candidates application in order for them to be successful (again that is why if we had clear goals even as individual assessors we can refer back to it)</p>
<p><strong>Qualifications</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>I am very aware of the projects and work of guilds in the Bankless ecosystem</li>
<li>I personally onboard people to BDAO based on their skill set to specific projects</li>
<li>I have run grant projects and applied for traditional grants</li>
<li>Frequently attend GC meetings to listen in</li>
<li>A DAO governance engineer and DAO governance educator whose goal is to create processes and designs for those intended to participate to do so</li>
<li>Incredibly pragmatic but will provide helpful feedback</li>
<li>Always there to help a member in need a</li>

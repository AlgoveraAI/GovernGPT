<p>Welcome to the Marketing Department Content Coordinator Role Holder Election for S6. The need for this election has been triggered by the announced absence of the elected Content Coordinator for S6, due to a mix of personal and professional reasons, which was not going to allow the role holder to carry out the required responsibilities.</p>

I have been in the marketing guild(now marketing department) since the last season and Iâ€™ve carefully taken time to understand the workflow of how content is generated, published and coordinated, having partaken in certain tasks myself. This new season, I believe I can drive the Content department of the MD forward and raise the level of activity for content creation. I aim to:<br>
. Ensure a seamless and timely flow of tasks from creation to approval.<br>
. Make room for diverse contents thatâ€™ll cover more areas than the ones already in operation.<br>
. Increase the activity rate of people for making excellent content in the marketing department.</p>

<p>[This is meant to be an open discussion until there is enough discourse to build a full proposal]</p>
<h3>
<a name="current-problem-2" ></a>Current Problem:</h3>
<p>A large part of the value our social DAO brings is the ability to participate in the discord and our current guest pass system is is infinitely renewable leading to a lack of value capture and retention.</p>
<h3>
<a name="summary-3" ></a>Summary</h3>
<ul>
<li>This discussion is meant for a new system for monetizing our guest pass without limiting access to our organization</li>
<li>A <a >No Loss Subscription <span >3</span></a> is the ability for a potential new member to stake tokens in order to receive a guest pass NFT while allowing the DAO to perform safe yield farming strategies to monetize the staked tokens
<ul>
<li>Members will have the ability to redeem 100% of their stake while being able to participate in the BanklessDAO discord</li>
<li>The DAO treasury guild will be able to monetize members that are just exploring the DAO</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Using this <a >basic model <span >3</span></a> we can extract some takeaways
<ul>
<li>With the assumption of only 500 guest passes we could expect a yearly revenue of around $2,250</li>
<li>While this is not a lot of money now, this proposal is following the assumption that either the DAO scales or we choose to scale this as a fiscal policy for our full time members</li>
</ul>
</li>

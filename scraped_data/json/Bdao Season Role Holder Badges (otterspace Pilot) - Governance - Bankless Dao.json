    "Summary": "Partner with Otterspace 11 to issue season delimited role holder badges. This would include all Guild Coordinators and Project Champions. Those persons would then be permitted to issue any other role badges required within their groups.By mirroring the DAO’s existing roles via Soulbound Tokens, we:Make our org structure visible on-chain\nCreate historic mementos for role holders\nCreate data for future reputations systems\nAid the community in communication\nParticipate in the Otterspace rollout and have the opportunity to provide feedbackThis proposal is a low-risk way to increase our resiliency, transparency, and reputation mechanics.",
    "BACKGROUND": "Otterspace is building a flexible and easy-to-use infrastructure for DAOs to use non-transferable NFTs, which are called Badges. Badges can enable DAOs to perform non-financialized governance, automate permissions (e.g., access rights as part of a season pass), manage community-specific reputation/credentials, and create better incentive systems. The Otterspace product is currently live on the Goerli Testnet and will be launching on Optimism Mainnet in August.Otterspace is building three components:A token standard (EIP-4973 5)\nAn open-source protocol\nAn application for easy no-code badge managementOtterspace’s goal is to provide any community with the tools they need to bring Badges to life, whether it is just the token, the protocol, or the application.BadgesIn the Otterspace app, DAO operators can set up their DAO, create badges (EIP-4973 non-transferable tokens) and distribute them to addresses. To avoid non-consensual minting 2, the Otterspace Protocol requires recipients to claim and mint the badge themselves. Airdrops are not possible. As the protocol is on Optimism, the transaction costs incurred are marginal.Some of the common use cases Otterspace has helped DAOs with include:Different levels of membership (think newbie vs. core-contributor).\nDifferent teams or guilds (media guild, dev guild…).\nAchievements/rewards like “contributor of the month”.\nDifferent roles with a badge expiry date (for example, the 90-day community lead role).\nGuest pass with a 7-day expiry.\nSkills (for example, Solidity level 10).Badge UtilityBadges are especially powerful because they can have utility attached to them – Otterspace is collaborating with multiple DAO tooling providers to integrate the badges across the DAO tooling landscape.\nBadges can be used for governance (e.g., Snapshot), access permissions (e.g., Guild, Discord, Clarity), payments (e.g., Coordinape) and task management (e.g. Wonderverse). Additionally, badges are useful simply as a way of showing off reputation, history, and experience.\nThe Otterspace Protocol is being developed as an open set of smart contracts, so DAOs can compose and integrate pieces into their own tech stack, and other app developers can construct custom front-ends.",
    "MISSION & VALUES ALIGNMENT": "Otterspace wants to get more active in the Bankless ecosystem and collaborate for the following reasons:Strong mission alignment around onboarding mainstream users to Web3 through its easy-to-understand user interface.\nOtterspace wants to support and enable collaboration at scale in Web3, such as in the context of large DAOs like bDAO.\nbDAO is already considering how SBTs may be adopted to enhance the membership experience and governance, making Otterspace an ideal partner.",
    "SPECIFICATION": "The proposal is to generate badges for season-delimited membership of Bankless by using the Otterspace protocol and app. Doing so will:Make our org structure visible on-chain\nCreate a more holistic representation of membership\nCreate data for future reputations systems\nAid the community in communicationLearn more: Website 11, Badges MVP 5, Pitch deck 5, Technical documentation 2, EIP-4973 5, Mirror",
    "Process": "Otterspace is designed to be a decentralized system that can be community managed. However, to begin with the process of creating the first set of badges will be somewhat centralized, with decentralization happening over time.Setting up the Bankless communityWithin Otterspace, each DAO and sub-DAO/team/guild are represented by an ERC721 token called a ‘Raft’ (a Raft is a group of otters)\nThe wallet holding the Raft Token is the admin of the badge collection\nFirst, the main Bankless DAO and sub-DAOs/teams/guilds will be created. The Raft Tokens will be distributed to the wallets that administer those groupsBadge DistributionThe main DAO and/or sub-DAOs will issue badges to project champions and guild coordinators\nChampions and coordinators can then create and issue badges to any other internal role holders.Badge TermBadges can have expiration dates and artwork that are specific to the season in which they were issued.\nBy limiting the role of NFTs to seasons, we reduce risk and complexity.\nWe also create an on-chain map of our role holders over time.Potential Future UsesDuring the seasons, the badges could be used for multiple use cases, such as governance within Snapshot (As considered in the Governator Project Season 3) or access permissions to Discord channels or workspaces.\nWhile the badges itself are non-financial (can’t be sold to the highest bidder), they can be tied to a conditional payment, such as a subscription.",
    "FINANCIAL IMPLICATIONS": "There is no direct cost to implement this proposal, but we are asking all participating cohorts to donate 5k BANK$ to pay for the design of the season’s thematic badges.",
    "BRAND USAGE": "bDAO will be listed and advertised as a partner in the Otterspace launch in publications and social media.",
    "SUCCESS METRICS OR KPIS": "This implementation is primarily about learning and growing with Otterspace. They are rolling out Community and Contributor pages in the coming weeks and more coarse minting permissions with time. This pilot project puts us at the front of the line to participate and influence the direction of community badging.",
    "NEXT STEPS": "Start a channel with all participating badge recipients\nKick off the design process for the season badges\nCollect donation pledges\nDistribute badges to Guild Coordinators and Project Champions\nCreate a badge management tutorial for Coordinators / Champions",

    "SUMMARY": "ConsenSys is seeking the opportunity to onboard some of their employees to the Bankless DAO in order to help the DAO across various guilds and projects, allowing their employees to learn how to effectively explore DAO culture, experiment with external contribution in the DAO community and continuously provide value to the wider Ethereum ecosystem.As part of this DAOlationship proposal, ConsenSys would like to secure 50 Guest Passes for a 3 month period so that ConsenSys employees can have a trial period to experience the Bankless DAO prior to independently joining the Bankless DAO (i.e. purchasing 35,000 BANK tokens on their own) and potentially contributing if they should choose to do so.In addition, Bankless DAO will offer additional stewardship, educational materials and support to an agreed upon capacity and ConsenSys will allocate an equal value to this partnership.At ConsenSys, we encourage all employees to dedicate at least one full day every month to third party initiatives external to ConsenSys—namely, DAOs. This is an org-wide plan for employees to migrate to a contributor model, unbundle the mystic DAO ecosystem, and to “green pill” our people into becoming fully consumed by web3 culture.",
    "BACKGROUND": "ConsenSys is making this proposal because we are committed to bettering both the overall Ethereum ecosystem and the DAO ecosystem and we believe that a DAOlationship with Bankless will result in several positive outcomes for both parties as well as learning outcomes that the overall community will benefit from.Positive Outcomes - BanklessBankless DAO will gain access to potentially valuable contributors who have the opportunity to contribute some of their working hours to third party initiatives external to ConsenSys—namely, DAOs.\n\n\nBankless DAO may be able to increase the output of various guilds if these working relationships prove to be fruitful; in turn, this will increase the footprint of the Bankless brand\n\n\nBankless DAO will have a direct line of communication with a steward from the ConsenSys team to ensure that all parties are satisfied with the relationship; specifically, it is less likely that contributors will disappear or become disengaged as can sometimes be the case with individual contributorsPositive Outcomes - ConsenSysAllow ConsenSys employees to experiment with contributing to one of the most respected DAOs in the ecosystem\n\n\nConsenSys employees will gain insight into how a well functioning DAO organizes and operates\n\n\nConsenSys employees will be able to expand their horizons in terms of the types of work that can be completed in DAOs and potentially find new areas of interest (ex. writing / research / operations / marketing) that they may not be exposed to in their day-to-day work lifeLearning Outcomes - Both PartiesStrengthen the DAO onboarding process for both parties and learn previously unrecognized insights about DAO onboarding",
    "MISSION & VALUES ALIGNMENT": "The Bankless DAO mission and values are as follows:Mission: We will help the world go Bankless by creating user-friendly onramps for people to discover decentralized financial technologies through education, media, and culture.Vision: To live in a world where anyone with an internet connection has access to the financial tools needed to achieve financial independenceValues: Education, Integrity, Decentralized Governance, and CultureEducation: We learn from each other. We seek to become a trusted guide that empowers people all over the globe to adopt decentralized finance by sharing accurate, truthful, and objective information.Integrity: We operate transparently and build trust through radically public discourse and financial auditability.Decentralized Governance: We put decision making into the hands of the collective. We create legitimacy through an environment where the best ideas win.Culture: We reward action and embrace risk. We empower our community to continually drive new initiatives by providing a space to self-organize and quickly move from idea to action.ConsenSys values are as follows:We act with kindness.We continually evolve.We cultivate community.We embrace innovation.We deliver impact.As you can see, there is a lot of overlap between the core values of both Bankless and ConsenSys. In particular, both parties aim to educate and onboard as many people as possible into the Ethereum ecosystem and to help all citizens of the world to evolve and embrace innovation.By partnering with ConsenSys, the Bankless DAO will be able to further their mission by gaining access to potential contributors who share these same values and who have a proven track record of delivering on projects across various departments (guilds).",
    "SCOPE OF WORK": "As part of this proposal, ConsenSys employees will be encouraged to identify 1-2 guilds and 1-2 work stream/active workgroups for their potential contributions during this 3 month trial period. In addition, it is highly encouraged that ConsenSys employees join the weekly calls of their selected guilds as well as the DAO-wide community call on Friday’s at 3pm UTC.Details on specific guilds and call times can be found below:Community CallJoin the weekly community call on Friday 3pm UTC!Writers GuildJoin the weekly calls on Monday 5:30pm UTC and contribute to one of the following workgroups:\n\nNewsletter team\nEditorial and Publishing Arm (EPA)\nBankless PublishingTreasury GuildJoin the weekly tokenomics department calls on Friday 2pm UTC and contribute to one of the following workgroups:\n\n\nL2 Migration Workgroup\n\n\nBank Utility Workgroup\n\n\nTokenomics Leveling Up Initiative\n\n\nJoin the weekly treasury management calls on Wednesday 2pm UTC and contribute to one of the following teams:\n\n\nGuiding Principles Documentation (Governance) Team\n\n\nAccounting Reconciliation Team\n\n\nInvestment Planning Team\n\n\nProject Revenue Recognition TeamResearch GuildJoin the weekly calls on Monday 4pm UTC and contribute to one of the following active workgroups:\n\n\nBankless Research\n\n\nDAO Sentiment Tracker\n\n\nTestDAOOperations GuildJoin the weekly calls on Tuesday 6pm UTC and contribute to one of the following workstreams:\n\n\nDAO Cartography\n\n\nCoordinate\n\n\nNPS Surveys / NPS Implementor\n\n\nCommunity Calls\n\n\nNotion Administration\n\n\nSeasonal Planning\n\n\nCommunity Stewards\n\n\nDiscord Administration\n\n\nGM.xyz | web3 native social mediaMarketing GuildJoin the weekly calls on Thursday 6pm UTC and contribute to one of the following workstreams:\n\n\nExternal Marketing Campaign Team\n\n\nContent Creation on Social Media:\n\nTwitter\nInstagram\nFacebook\nTelegram\nLinkedIn\nTikTokLegal GuildJoin the weekly calls on Thursday 3pm UTC and contribute to one of the following workstreams:\n\n\nDecentralized Law\n\n\nTax Corner\n\n\nWhitepaper\n\n\nCrypto Legal Observations\n\n\nDAO legal entityEducation GuildJoin the weekly calls on Sunday 3pm UTC and contribute to one of the following workgroups:\n\n\nAdministrator Workgroup\n\n\nEducation Workgroup\n\n\nCross-Guild Coordination & Promotion Workgroup\n\n\nTalent Coordinator WorkgroupDesign GuildJoin the weekly calls on Wednesday 4pm UTC and contribute to one of the following projects:\n\n\nCommunity Call POAP design\n\n\nInstagram Strategy & Design for BanklessDAO\n\n\nDecentralized Arts Weekly Spotlight\n\n\nDAO Heat Design Contest\n\n\nDesign Guild Weekly Newsletter\n\n\nBankless Designers - The Drawing Board Website\n\n\nExternal Marketing Campaign TeamDAOlationshipsJoin the weekly calls on Monday 7pm UTC and contribute to one of the following workstreams:\n\n\nFocused Demos & Presentation\n\n\nAMA Special Ops\n\n\nPMA (Pitch Me Anything) Workgroup\n\n\nExternal Marketing Campaign TeamDeveloper’s GuildJoin the weekly calls on Monday 6pm UTC and contribute to one of the following projects:\n\n\nBankless Academy\n\n\nBankless Checkout\n\n\nBankless Loans\n\n\nBounty Board\n\n\nDAO Website\n\n\nDEGEN\n\n\nDev First Quest\n\n\nDev Guild - Knowledge Session\n\n\nGov Bots\n\n\nMad Hatter - The BanklessDAO Discord Bot\n\n\nMobile App/Content Gateway\n\n\nSolidity TrainingAudio-Visual GuildJoin the weekly calls on Wednesday 7pm UTC and contribute to one of the following initatives:\n\n\nAV Guild Services Workgroup\n\n\nExternal Marketing Campaign Team\n\n\nYoutube GQ Team\n\n\nPodcast Hatchery\n\n\nBanklessHQ ClipsAnalytics GuildJoin the weekly calls on Thursday 2am UTC and contribute to one of the following workstreams:\n\n\nDAO Dash\n\n\nBounty Board Queries\n\n\nOnboard MVO\n\n\nPOAP Metrics/Analytics\n\n\nDiscord Data/Metrics\n\n\nDAO Member Categories\n\n\nDAO Treasury Dashboard\n\n\nTwitter Analytics\n\n\nTipping Metrics/Analytics\n\n\nBANK Trading Volume\n\n\nSocial Media Metrics\n\n\nCurrent BANK Allocation\n\n\nSocial Analytics for B2B-InitiativeAdditional List of Projects of Interest:Bankless Card\nBankless Academy\nCrypto Sapiens\nPodcast Hatchery\nBanklessAfrica\nBankless DAOplomats\nThe Rug\nGovernator\nDAOversity\nBankless Mobile App\nBankless Nouns WTF\nBankless Loans\nBanklessDAO Weekly Rollup\nbDAO at global events\nFight Club (NFT gated)\nIMN - International Media Nodes\nUltrasound Merch Supply ChainAdditional details regarding specific projects can be found within the “proposal” column of the BanklessDAO Projects Notion:Notion\n  \n\n  \n    \n\nNotion – The all-in-one workspace for your notes, tasks, wikis, and databases. 7\n\n  A new tool that blends your everyday work apps into one.

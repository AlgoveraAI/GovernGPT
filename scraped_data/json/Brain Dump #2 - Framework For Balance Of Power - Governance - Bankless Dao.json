    "Introduction": "About a week in, we’re seeing hierarchies form. @Silver4k wrote a wonderful post 11 about the internal social layer that’s forming, critiquing the centralization of rapid decision-making. Silver was polite in his phrasing, but his critique is an existential one - There is a gap in soft power forming between. He says,A meritocratic contribution-based distribution of power is happening on the social layer and is being coordinated by founders and a core group, with status and positions being granted to those who show initiative or produce results that are noticed through a nomination process.In theory, this sounds like a good method. Nominations? Meritocratic? Initiative? All great things, but there is still centralization around BanklessHQ, but also with those that have Level 2 Contributor status in the Discord.On the social layer, those in the inner circles at the highest levels will eventually be disincentivized to make nominations and dilute their status. - SilverWhat follows is a general framework on how we can keep these natural hierarchies and how to buffet them with mechanisms that balance the scales of power  I am grateful to everyone that helped me solidify and workshop this framework. Thank you. As always, dissent and criticism are welcome.",
    "The Hierarchy": "New channels will unlock for you as you participate in the DAO. Initially, there are three levels of discord channel access.\n\n\nLevel 1: Member (35,000 BANK)\n\nLevel 2: Contributor (35,000 BANK + Invitation by Genesis Team)\n\nLevel 3: Whale (150,000 BANK)This clear segmentation was the beginning of our hierarchy. I think, for the most part, we can work with it. Now that we’ve had time to simmer for a week, I think we can iterate:Standing\nStatus\n\n\n\n\nLevel 0\nParticipant\n\n\nLevel 1\nMember\n\n\nLevel 2\nContributor\n\n\nLevel 3\nCore\n\n\n—\nWhales\n\n\n—\nGenesisHere we have the addition of a Level 0 and Level 3 and the separation of Whales/Gensis from any standing.(L0) Participant: Those who do not have the minimum required $BANK to join, but still participate in the community. They can be in #Courtyard, forums. Some have small amounts of BANK and can vote.\n(L1) Member: Passive player. Votes regularly. Some degree of forum posts and Discord activity. Members have the minimum $BANK required to formally enter. Can earn $BANK through community work and seasons.\n(L2) Contributors: Small group of active player and community leader. Coordinates seasons and has clear responsibilities. Are relied on by others to execute. Task oriented. Receiving $BANK through some variable compensation model.\n(L3) Core: Smaller group of core players. Minimum expectation of full-time commitment, often much more. Formal snapshot vote. Compensation is fixed and directly from the Treasury.\n\nWhales: Can be L1+\n\nGenesis: Can be any level, though current status is L1These levels relate to the previous brain dump post. Particularly in the context of the diagram below. Mapping these roles, here’s what we will typically find that L0s and L1s dominate the resource and governance layer, while L2s and L3s are orchestrators. (Read here 2 about soft and hard consensus.)Blank diagram1200×440 14.1 KB",
    "Power Dynamics": "We can see power centralizing around the L2 and L3 members that make up the small Orchestration Layer. And that brings us back here.On the social layer, those in the inner circles at the highest levels will eventually be disincentivized to make nominations and dilute their status. - SilverHere are some rules that help provide some balance. Note these %s are not set in stone:Before the beginning of each season, L2s and L3s submit formal proposals for snapshot voting. Anyone with BANK is able to vote. L3s submit their proposals individually, each requiring >50% from BANK holders. L2s submit their proposals as part of an Initiative (defined below).\n\n\nDuring each season, L2 and L3 members can nominate any other L1 or L0 member to L2 status and make an argument for their inclusion. (This is how things have been going so far if you look through #ops-general.) L2 and L3 members vote and require >50% majority and are given a “free-trial” period during the season before having to go through the formal verification process via vote. In the future, I can see this workflow going:L2s and L3s submit proposal before season n\n\nThose who are accepted nominate their sponsee for the upcoming season\nBefore the beginning of season n+1, nominated L2s must not go through the same voting process as their sponsor.L2 members can remove other L2s from Contributor status with a >50% majority\n\n\nL1 members can appeal any accepted nomination to L2 with a >25% vote. (We can worry about dispute resolution when we get there.)\n\n\nL1 members can remove any L2 or L3 member with a >50% majorityI know, it’s a lot. Maybe one of these day’s I’ll make a visual. But this framework does two important things: (1) It recognizes the different levels of commitment DAO members can make, from 6 hours a week to 60. (2) It creates a chain of accountability that always goes back to $BANK holders.",
    "Working Groups, Initiatives, and Mandates - Oh My!": "The next topic I want to cover are these “Proposals.” Yesterday, a few of us spontaneously hopped on a call (it was super cool, people just kept coming. We even missed ETH hitting $4K) and were chatting. Expanding on the idea of Guilds, we came up with additional mental models. Namely those of Working Groups, Initiatives, and Mandates.Initiatives are a special kind of proposals. Informed by community discussion, they perform in broad strokes, handling challenging problems that require careful coordination. Initiatives usually require a budget to be approved. L2s introduce Initiatives for snapshot voting. Initiatives are promises to the community. If accepted, they turn into Mandates by the community. Initiatives are valid if they are authored by at least one L2 or co-sponsored by at least two L2s. Each initiative has its own Working Group. These are typically the authors/sponsors of the Initiatives. These working groups can be a combination of L1s, L2, and L3s.",
    "Example: Moving to Layer 2 Tech": "At some point, we will need to move to Layer 2 to reduce fees and support faster transactions. Conversations are already being had 4 on the topic. In this case, a few things can happen:Community sentiment builds enough for an L2/L3 member to take action and start drafting an Initiative with vocal community members as co-sponsors.\nL1 community members make a formal request for an Initiative that L2/L3 are obligated to consider and delegate when possible\nL1 community members author the proposal and find two L2/L3 sponsorsDepending on the scope of the project, the Initiative may be proposed for the next season, or the current one for emergencies/smaller projects, but typically Initiative are written in preparation for the next season. Very roughly, these Initiative proposals must contain:Description/Problem/Solution\nBudget\nTimeline\n\nOKRs 4 that are measured against KPIs 1.L2 and L3 performance is judged based on their ability to deliver on their Promise and meet the DAO’s Mandate, giving BANK holders to validate movement between levels. Every L2/L3 member that is part of a Working Group is responsible for the Initiatives they have chose to author or co-sponsor.",
    "Conclusion": "I think I’m going to wrap it up here.Create Levels 0-3 of membership. Members of higher levels are community members trusted by BANK holders\nThrough a submission and review process, all L2/L3 members are ultimately approved by BANK holders. This creates a balance of power between centralized decision making around L2/L3 and the true authority of L0s/L1s\nL2 has variable compensation. L3 has fixed compensation. (Perhaps another post about this later.)"

    "Election 3/12 - Governance & Treasury Coordinator": "As Mr. V needs to free up some time he suggested splitting the role into two parts (Governance and Treasury) and also splitting the salary. Mr. V would remain the treasury coordinator and hand over the governance responsibility to Sandeepdas.Candidate: sandeepdas#2062\nI am going to move out of my role as the LinkedIn Specialist for bDAO at the end of Season 5. One of my primary reasons for stepping down, in spite of the success of LinkedIn in S5 and its‚Äô importance going forward, is because it always felt as a part of the whole pie (but unable to influence and shape anything for the Marketing Guild). I have been involved in the Governance of the MG unofficially through my feedback and contributions to the MG Constitution in S4 and S5. The Governance aspect is a critical component of a Guild‚Äôs success. If I am elected, I would like to make Governance a fundamental part of how the Guild operates on a day-to-day basis, and also around the important functional and budgetary decisions it takes. Effective governance ensures free and fairer participation, the right level of incentives for the right skill sets, driving home the impact of strategic initiatives, and having more impact from the funding we receive each season. My governance vision, in addition to realizing the above objectives, will also frame how the MG should create its own distinct identity, create a center of excellence, and strengthen bDAO‚Äôs image and perception as the biggest media DAO.Candidate: Mr. V | mariokondo.eth#2771\nAs current Governance and Treasury Role Holder since season 3, I intend to serve the guild moving forward. However, my time does not allow for this role fully so I suggested splitting the responsibility and not running for governance. This way I can focus on continuing timely payouts and guild remuneration while the governance coordinator can focus the time on improving the framework.100%Yes (Split Role Sandeepdas & Mr. V)0%No (Please comment below why)40votersShow vote",

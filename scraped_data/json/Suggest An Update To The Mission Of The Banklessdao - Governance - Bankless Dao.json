    "Media related": "Writing newsletters, blogs, articles\nCreating podcasts, Crypto sapiens, podcast hatchery, AV content\nCreating educational media, bankless academy, workshops\nCreating NFTs, DAOpunks, emerging artist art, metafactory merch, NFT flipper tools\nPerpetuating bankless culture, memes, satires, talk shows\nInternational media nodes to spread the word",
    "Social related": "NFT club\nBankless whale club\nLevel 1 club\nVibe club and games",
    "Further explanation": "If we look deep into what we are doing today, we are a Media and Social DAO, and we should do these things with pride.The old world cannot understand these metaversal and web3 things, and hence, cannot seem to come up with great content for this space. And that’s what we excel at, and we are the first mover.Currently there could be 100-300 million metaverse citizens, when this number reaches 10x, there will be bigger demand for high quality media that BanklessDAO and LLC is currently providing.People would want to listen, read, live and breath, great untainted, unfiltered content.And this I feel should also form our main revenue stream. We can start gating our great content behind $BANK tokens, DAOpunk NFT, POAPs, or a small subscription.",
    "Further TLDR:": "I do not suggest we change any of our activities, just changing the mission to more clearly represent our current BanklessDAO activities.This proposed mission makes all our lives so much easier, because we clearly know what we need to do now.",
    "Why the use of metaverse?": "We are living in the metaverse, interacting with people through the internet. I considered using web3 or other terms, but I came back to this term. Essentially this term has to encapsulate this new Bankless, web3 world we are now operating in.",
    "Measurements of success?": "This new mission is easier to measure success as well. We can count the percentage of metaverse citizens engaging with our content. We can count the percentage of DAOs engaging with us. We can find out which media company new DAOs first go to. Like what is their “go-to” media powerhouse.Please let me know how you feel.Please adopt this new mission and bring it to snapshot I do not agree, keep the current one I do not agree, I suggest…26votersShow results"

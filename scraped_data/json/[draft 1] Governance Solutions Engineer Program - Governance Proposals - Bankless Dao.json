    "SUMMARY": "This proposal, in its primitive draft form, seeks to address two important challenges for the DAO:Contributor Retention\nStrategic PrioritizationIt outlines the need for these two problem spaces to have a dedicated team responsible for creating effective solutions that aligns with the community’s sentiment.Deliverables are defined as a thorough and community-aligned specification in order to update our governance procedures and create room for growth. A close comparable is the original Season Specification 9 that continues to act as an important cornerstone in our governance model.As such, this proposal calls for:Three elected members of the DAO to lead these two problem spaces, known as Governance Solutions Engineer (Gov SE). Each Gov SE will be granted 100,000 BANK as an initial allocation in Season 3. At the end of the Season, when deliverables are presented to the DAO, the DAO will vote on whether to apply a bonus of up to 200,000 BANK for a total maximum of 300,000 per member\n500,000 BANK set aside for each problem space to incentivize participation in working groups, led by the three elected members. This 500,000 BANK would be allocated to the working group and distributed as per the group’s decision, not at the Gov SE’s discretion.",
    "BACKGROUND": "When building an organization, there’s this mental model of working in the organization vs working on the organization. I highlighted this distinction in Onwards to Season 3! under the Season 3: Revenge of Moloch heading, so I’ll just quickly summarize here:As organizations grow and scale, their underlying operational model must change too. As new organizational behavior and information arise, systems must adapt and modify. Our current operational model - grants, guilds, projects, proposals, compensation - was largely ideated between May 4th and June 8th.Six months in, we’re seeing where the existing operational model is insufficient:In Season 2, the Grants Committee ran out of funding with a month left in the Season, despite increasing the budget by an additional 40% from Season 1\nProjects have come back for funding without a clear way to evaluate whether these projects should be funded a second or third time.\nCommunity voting does not reflect critical evaluation. We largely vote yes without taking the time to evaluate the full scope of a proposal.\n(Related to above) People do not have the bandwidth to participate in proposal discussion\nGrants Committee sometimes does not have sufficient subject matter expertise to evaluate project scope (namely developer projects)\nWe have no way to evaluate the value that a project brings do the DAO when coming back for funding\nCompensation was set at 1000 BANK/hr, back when BANK average 5 cents per token. Today, we sit at 15.\nCompensation varies heavily in the DAO between standard roles like Talent Scout, Guild Coordinator, Secretary, etc.\nL2 contributor status doesn’t accommodate for Guest Pass members that have shown themselves worthy of L2 status.The points above reflect challenges that come from outgrowing our current framework. Not to mention the new challenges unforeseen:SubDAOs\nToken utility within the ecosystem (eg. Driving utility to BANK token, like using it to make purchases or gating content behind a token threshold via Mintgate 3)As a quick aside, I see the problems broken down into two main categories:\n\n\nContributor Retention - How do we properly reward active DAO contributors, accounting for the varying skillsets and time commitment people are making?\n\nStrategic Prioritization - How do we, as a DAO, learn how to say no?My point here is that, in Season 0, we directed our attention in working on the organization and building systems/processes. In Season 1 and Season 2, all those same people worked in the organization. Now, we have new information and behavior that are forcing us to re-evaluate those systems/processes that we built.Now you may stop and say, “Well okay, why don’t we just spin up a working group in this…? Let’s just find a bunch of people interested in solving these problems and let’s get on with it!” Good question! I tried. Nearly 3 months ago, I created this forum post: ALL HANDS ON DECK: Compensation and PLM Working Groups 6. In it, I called for a group of interested parties to help scope out our inadequate compensation guidance. The result? Despite having 15 people signal their interest 2, we only met three times 1 and we delivered on this flimsy forum post 3.I see this failure resulting from two factors:Our working group did not have explicit signaling from the DAO that this was a major priority. We’re all fucking busy in our respective niches. Without an explicit mandate from the DAO saying “This is important, we need people on this project,” it’s really difficult to activate people to redirect their resources and attention on this matter.\nI did not have the time and bandwidth to lead this working group. I was active in a number of different places in the DAO, and without some social signal and explicitly incentivization, it eventually fell down my priority list.Given my experience here, I want to propose a new model - One that creates an explicit mandate from the DAO to focus on these two problem areas and properly incentivizes participation.Ladies and Gentlemen, I’d like to introduce the Governance Solutions Engineer Program",
    "MISSION & VALUES ALIGNMENT": "I’m going to be lazy here, but in the Onwards to Season 3! forum post, I did a quick temp check on this topic with overwhelming support of a focus on Governance and Coordination:Screenshot 2021-12-16 183215895×452 24.3 KB",
    "SPECIFICATION": "",
    "What are Gov SEs?": "In the failures section just above, I pointed out how I did not have the bandwidth to coordinate/lead the Compensation working group. As such, the working group ended up falling to the wayside on my list of priorities.Given this outcome, I think it’s important to explicitly assign coordinator responsibility. We need people who view it as their #1 priority to lead these working groups. As such, I define Gov SEs as:Governance-minded DAO members elected to spec out a comprehensive solution to mission-critical DAO infrastructure challenges.\nThese members are not to operate in silos and make decisions on behalf of the DAO. They are to work with the DAO to find the optimal solution by progressively designing solutions, presenting them to the DAO, capturing feedback, and iterating.\nGov SEs have appropriate context for the problems they are working on and properly embody the values of the DAO. They are trusted by their social reputation for acting in the best interest in the DAO.\n\nGov SEs must make this their #1 priority. They may hold one other leadership position, but that’s it.\n\nFor example, I am the Ops Guild Coordinator and (defacto) Writers Guild Governance Coordinator. I would have to step down from one of those positions in order to be a Gov SE.\nThey may participate in lower order activities. Eg, if I wanted to write a piece of the Newsletter, I can do that. But I cannot accept a role on the newsletter team.\nGov SEs cannot be on the Grants Committee (not 100% sure on this… what do you think?)A successful Gov SE program should result in major clout for Gov SEs in the DAO. At the risk of sounded vain… what if there were more frogmonkees? Ooh ooh aah aah motherfucker.",
    "What is the Scope of Work?": "Right now, I think the scope of work should be limited to our most existential threats: (1) Contributor Retention and (2) Strategic Prioritization. We do have other important challenges that we can expect down the pipeline, but given this is the first time testing a program like this, I would caution against taking on more we can chew without testing this first.Contributor RetentionRefining the Guest Pass, L1, and L2 system to be more inclusive\n\nIncludes ways to offboard contributors that no longer meet the activity/recognition threshold\n\n\nCreate a compensation framework that can be updated and:\n\nDefine global compensation that standardizes compensation rules for the entire DAO\nProvides guidance on letting projects/guild define local compensation.\n\n\nEnvisions a new incentive model that rewards long-term contributors that stick with the DAO for over a year.Strategic PrioritizationCreate an evaluation framework to help the DAO make strategic decisions with treasury and grant funding\n\nie. Critically thinking about how projects fit into our Mission and Vision or directing people to similar projects\nThis would include standardizing what Guilds are able to ask for vs. what needs to be spun out into a project\n\n\nCreate a new evaluation process that optimizes for both community consensus and responsible decision making\n\nIe. Introducing reviews by subject matter experts or a group to align project specifications with how other projects operate\n\n\nRefine and formalize the funding mechanism in alignment with the evaluation framework and processes\n\nie. Can we decentralize the grants committee?Deliverables would include a detailed specification that we can begin to implement in Season 4. The closest comparable is the original Season Specification 9 that still serves as an important guiding document for the DAO to this day.This deliverable would have to be in its final form, if not extremely close. The idea is to have something we can implement by the end of Season 3 going into Season 4. As such, community feedback must already be included. I want to acknowledge that this community feedback can take time but if Draft 1 is done properly, much of the community consensus will already be aligned.",
    "Gov SEs and Working Groups": "Earlier, I said about Gov SEs:These members are not to operate in silos and make decisions on behalf of the DAO. They are to work with the DAO to find the optimal solution by progressively designing solutions, presenting them to the DAO, capturing feedback, and iterating.One method of working with the DAO is to create a working group around these two problem spaces. As such, Gov SEs will have to work publicly in these working group. Part of their responsibility will be coordinating these working groups, somewhere between a Guild Coordinator and Project Manager.",
    "Elections": "For this initial run of an explicitly tasked and incentivized working group, I want to propose three Gov SEs for these two problem spaces. These three people can organize however they wish to, whether they assign one person to each problem space and one person as a “floater” or tackle it all together.For electing these individuals, I propose that:We have a two week submission period\nSubmissions must include:\n\nDiscord handle\nReason for applying\nQualifications\nDetailed thoughts on how you would solve these two problem spaces\nSponsor(s) (i.e., those who will second your nomination - the more the merrier!)\n\n\nOnce all submissions are in, we move to Snapshot and use the weighted voting mechanic 3 to elect three members over the span of a week.",
    "FINANCIAL IMPLICATIONS": "Maximum funding for this initiative would be: 1,900,000 BANK. Any BANK unallocated will go back to the treasury at the end of this program.1,900,000 BANK is broken down as:Each Gov SE would be guaranteed 100,000 BANK salary\nAt the end Season 3, the DAO will vote for whether Gov SEs deserve a bonus. This bonus will reflect the delivery on a comprehensive solution that the community is happy with. Bonus will be a maximum of 200,000 BANK. Voters will be able to voted in increments of 50,000 (eg. 0, 50K, 100K, 150K, and 200K). Bonus will be calculated as a Total Weighted Average based on the results of these votes\nThe two working groups (for each problem space) will have an allocated budget of 500,000 BANK to collectively decide how to allocate and compensate members of the working group. Gov SEs may not draw from this allocation.\nAll funds will be held by a separate multi-sig that does not include Gov SEs as signers (perhaps the Grants Committee if Gov SEs cannot be on the Grants Committee either?)If you think this amount is too much… well have you looked at the scope of work?! Not only is it massive, but the value being provided upon successful delivery far outweighs the cost.",
    "SUCCESS METRICS OR KPIS": "Delivery of two detailed specifications by the end of Season 3 that already has community feedback folded into in order to execute and implement during Season 4.",
    "NEXT STEPS": "Align on the specification of this program\nDetermine where funding will come from - Treasury or Grants Committee?\n\nAccording to the [Draft 3 - Final] Firming Up Governance, I think there’s solid reasoning that this could go to Snapshot given this falls neatly into the Governance category.\n\n\nHold elections (this can be done in tandem with deciding where funds will come from)",

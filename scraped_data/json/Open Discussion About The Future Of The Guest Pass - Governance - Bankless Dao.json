    "How BanklessDAO Can Capitalize on the Guest Pass without compromising our values…": "[This is meant to be an open discussion until there is enough discourse to build a full proposal]",
    "Current Problem:": "A large part of the value our social DAO brings is the ability to participate in the discord and our current guest pass system is is infinitely renewable leading to a lack of value capture and retention.",
    "Summary": "This discussion is meant for a new system for monetizing our guest pass without limiting access to our organization\nA No Loss Subscription 3 is the ability for a potential new member to stake tokens in order to receive a guest pass NFT while allowing the DAO to perform safe yield farming strategies to monetize the staked tokens\n\nMembers will have the ability to redeem 100% of their stake while being able to participate in the BanklessDAO discord\nThe DAO treasury guild will be able to monetize members that are just exploring the DAO\n\n\nUsing this basic model 3 we can extract some takeaways\n\nWith the assumption of only 500 guest passes we could expect a yearly revenue of around $2,250\nWhile this is not a lot of money now, this proposal is following the assumption that either the DAO scales or we choose to scale this as a fiscal policy for our full time members",
    "Should we continue to explore this solution?": "Yes No19votersShow results"

    "BDIP SUMMARY": "The static forum quorum requirements set in the constitution do not reflect the activity of active contributors in the DAO which consequently leads to governance frustration. Instead, the suggestion is to adopt a formula based approach which can evolve as the activity in the DAO evolves.",
    "BDIP BACKGROUND": "Recently we saw in bDIP-02: Coordinated timings across bDAO 1 that in times when there are less active contributors, it was really difficult to reach quorum for something relatively simple. The quorum thresholds were defined in the constitution in a time when there were many more active contributors. The challenge with a static threshold is that it cannot reflect the number of active contributors in the DAO at any given time, this is especially relevant for an industry such as crypto where the attention can vary significantly between the bull and the bear phases.",
    "BDIP SPECIFICATION": "",
    "How can we address this challenge?": "",
    "Option A: Update thresholds at regular intervals": "This option allows contributors to suggest new thresholds based on manually sensing activity in the DAO. The con is the bDIP needs to reach a threshold each time for an update and there may be several updates required each year which costs a lot of admin overhead. Hence I do not recommend this option",
    "Option B: Update thresholds based on formula": "This option requires less changes as compared to option A if the formula allows for thresholds to be set dynamically based on activity within the DAO. Overall this reduces the admin overhead.",

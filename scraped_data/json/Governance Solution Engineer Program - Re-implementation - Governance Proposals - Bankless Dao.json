Distribution will be up to the 5 GSEs. They can choose to use Team Set Salaries or Coordinape.\n\n\nThe two working groups (Contributor alignment and Strategic Prioritization) will have an allocated budget of 500,000 BANK EACH to collectively decide how to allocate and compensate members of the working group. Gov SEs may not draw from this allocation.\nFunds will be held in a multi-sig held by the 5 GSEs\n\nOnce all compensation has been distributed, GSEs must produce a financial report outlining how funds were distributed.\nAny funds not distributed will be returned to the treasury",

    "TLDR": "Review and vote on GSE deliverables to complete GSE Cohort 1.\nContinue governance discussion in #governance 1 and #BDAO Governance Workstream",
    "Summary": "The GSE was an experiment that had high aims, a lot of goals and due to the breadth of focus a number of difficult challenges. Amidst that, the GSE cohort 1 created deliverables and suggestions that have helped move the DAO forward in terms of governance discussion and focus. Overall, I view this as a good learning opportunity, that has further pointed the DAO toward developing and refining our governance.",
    "BACKGROUND": "The GSE was proposed to organize a group of people at the DAO to address two important challenges for the DAO:Contributor Alignment - How do we properly reward active DAO contributors, accounting for the varying skill sets and time commitment people are making?\nStrategic Prioritization - What should we say no to? How do we, as a DAO, learn how to say no? How do we do this in a way that empowers the community to make decisions while also letting high-context individuals influence outcomes?The GSEs were elected and were tasked with creating deliverables that had the requirements of:Detailed specification to implement.\nCommunity consent and feedback must already be included.Through Seasons 4 and 5 they completed the above deliverables, and we are wrapping up in Season 6.",
    "FINANCIAL SPECIFICATION": "",
    "Base GSE Pay:": "Each Gov SE is guaranteed a 75,000 BANK salary.\n\n\nAt the end of the Season, the DAO will vote on two deliverables produced by the GSEs via forum vote. One for strategic prioritization and one for contributor Alignment. Each deliverable will be rated on a scale of 1 to 5, which will unlock additional compensation.\n\nEach deliverable will unlock up to 375K BANK\n\nEach rating will unlock 75K in funding. 1 = 75K, 2 = 150K, 3 = 225K, 4 = 300K, 5 = 375K\n\n\nWe recommend that they distribute this unlocked funding amongst each other through coordinape, to reflect individual contribution as measured by each other.\n\n\n\nFunds will be held in a multi-sig held by the 5 GSEs\n\nOnce all compensation has been distributed, GSEs must produce a financial report outlining how funds were distributed.\nAny funds not distributed will be returned to the treasury.",
    "Further Details:": "The two workstreams(contributor alignment and strategic prioritization), had 500k BANK each to allocate to work being done. The GSEs would like to compensate the following contributors for their work:Ispeaknerd 70k - Compensation plan\nSenad 70k - Compensation plan\nIcedcool 70k - Administration, and completion of GSE\nAloy 3k - Coordinator Roles 2",
    "Next Steps": "Upon the completion of this vote, the GSE will be free to kick off a coordinape to distribute funding amongst each other, compensate contributors, and return any funds not used back to the DAO.A future proposal is in the works to create a governance department for the DAO to further incentivize and support governance.Join the conversation in #governance 1 and #BDAO Governance Workstream",

    "SUMMARY": "The Role Analysis Study was a project conducted from November to December of 2022.\nThis post is to outline the ‘raw outputs’ as points of reference.\nThis research is going to help inform the Qualification & Necessity matrices which are elements of the compensation system revamp plan. The plan will be submitted as a DRAFT here on forums for community-revision later. The compensation system innovation procurement shall continue to be hosted under something similar to a governance body (department) of BanklessDAO, with an elected/appointed workstream/project lead and a support (buddy-system). That’s ultimately for the body to decide.",
    "BACKGROUND": "In late Q4 of 2022 a group of masters students from the University of Kentucky conducted a Role Analysis Study on behalf of BanklessDAO, which was funded by @saulthorin, former GSE and founder of talentDAO. The Studys’ purpose was to get the data that is required to establish Qualification & Necessity Score, one of several elements in the compensation system. Read my post from November for more context 1.",
    "DETAILS": "The final presentation has been recorded and the file is enclosed. The study provides us with insights and a better understanding of the guild- & governance-coordinator role. The information shall help us design the compensation system in consequence.12/5/2022 Presentation 13 of Role Analysis StudyBanklessDAO now has a contact at the University of Kentucky, Xiaowen Chen (PhD), Assistant Professor in Industrial/Organizational Psychology & Director of Big Data Lab for Organizational Effectiveness 1. She and her master students are open to an ongoing relationship with BanklessDAO through the establishment of a standard procedure of role analysis within our organisation.They could further analyse each role (in relationship to other roles) for a more holistic view of our compensation structure. This is a time consuming endeavour and pretty much TBD.",
    "NEXT STEPS": "Utilise this study to create Qualification & Necessity matrices\nCreate a post with the aforementioned compensation plan\nGet the community to weigh in"

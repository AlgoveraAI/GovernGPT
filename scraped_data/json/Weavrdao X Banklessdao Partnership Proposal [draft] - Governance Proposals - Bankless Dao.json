    "": "How do you feel about this partnership?LFG! I want to participate in the needle and will reach out to senad.eth #8782. I want to help with follow-up proposals and get involved. I have concerns about this partnership and will comment why.14votersShow results",
    "TL;DR": "This proposal aims to introduce WeavrDAO and the weavr protocol to the BanklessDAO community and the chance to participate in the crowdfunding of the first needle (tokenized property on the weavr platform).\nVerified BanklessDAO individuals are allowed to participate in the needle and will receive $THREAD tokens for every $USDC invested in the needle.",
    "Links & Resources": "Boston Real Estate Propsectus\nThe Property - 116 Englewood Ave, Apt 34, Boston MA 1\nWeavrDAO Website 5 - pw: WEAVR2022\nWeavr Gitbook\nWeavrDAO Discord\nWeavr On-Chain Voting & Ratification",
    "DEFINITIONS": "",
    "WEAV": "WEAV is the native governance token of Weavr. The WEAV token is a smart contract registered on the Arbitrum (arb) Ethereum Layer 2 blockchain. It follows the ERC-20 standard and is compatible with majority of wallets and exchanges currently supporting Ethereum-based cryptocurrencies.",
    "Needles": "A component of the Protocol that enables the purchase of an asset by the Governor corporation through crowdfunding as well as conducting movements of capital from the token holders to the Governor corporation. Imagine an individual brought a project idea to our platform to collaborate with others and bring it to reality. Weavr allows them to create a needle proposal with all the details of your idea for other investors to come and co-build. Then Weavr will facilitate the execution of the project to become a thread. A Needle dissolves after transitioning into a Thread.",
    "Threads": "Threads are properties cataloged in our club for which investors can buy fractions starting at $1USDC. A Thread is an on-chain governance system for the Governor corporation that legally owns the Thread property. Thread governance is based on Thread tokens and it is structured as a sub-DAO within the Weavr. Every thread is a DAO itself, a community where all individuals have voice and the right to vote. To ensure the growth on property value, we conduct a KYC/KYB that unlocks token-holders right to vote. All default votes and restrictions are design to comply with law and create a thriving system for the community. The owner of the property will be retaining 40% of their ownership, with voting power capped at 10% per person to provide whale protection.",
    "Thread tokens": "Thread tokens are ERC-20 tokens created by an indivisible smart contract on the Ethereum blockchain. Since the tokens are indivisible and impossible to replicate, they are the perfect medium for individual intellectual property tracing. These fractional tokens give each holder a percentage of property ownership that can be traded or exchanged on secondary markets.",
    "BACKGROUND": "About BanklessDAO\nThe BanklessDAO is a decentralized autonomous organization that acts as a steward of the Bankless Movement, progressing the world towards a future of greater freedom. BanklessDAO is a community of passionate Web3 thought-leaders who aim to educate new users, produce written and audio media, build DAO tooling, provide research & consulting services, develop Web3 scholarship, and create a social and creative home base for anyone in Web3. BanklessDAO is much more than a social DAO—it’s shipping, building, and innovating DAO.About WeavrDAO\nWeavrDAO is private members club and a decentralised platform for fractional Real Estate ownership. A market where people can participate in tokenized real estate starting at $1. The WeavrDAO operates as a DAO and by being a decentralized organization, the WeavrDAO allows individuals from all over the world to join, participate, and build on top of the organization. There are no geographical or economic entrance barriers to the WeavrDAOs potential to grow.",
    "MISSION & VALUES ALIGNMENT": "WeavrDAOs’ mission is to bring real estate cash flows and equity appreciation to individuals all over the world. Projects like Bankless Brazil or Bankless Africa could benefit tremendously by getting exposure to real estate that is perhaps not available in their areas or strongly controlled by the government. There is a possibility of a lease to own framework that allows “unbanked” mortgage-like instruments to encourage ownership. WeavrDAO helps the world go more Bankless by offering individuals the opportunity to own an asset that most of us can’t afford without having a bank as middleman - real estate!",
    "SPECIFICATION": "What WeavrDAO offers:\nOptions that contain WEAV to BanklessDAO individuals that participate in a needle:If the needle doesn’t hit the funding target of $270,000,- USDC, all individuals that have participated in the needle will be refunded.\nIf the needle hits the funding target of $270,000,- USDC, Thread tokens will be distributed according to the funding amount invested by individuals. The BanklessDAO Treasury will receive 20 WEAV tokens for each Thread token held by a BanklessDAO individual’s wallet, if the Thread tokens are held for more than 6 months in the same wallet that was used for verification.\nEntities that have invested more than $100,000 USDC will receive 40 WEAV tokens for each Thread token in their wallet, if the Thread tokens are held for more than 6 months in the same wallet that was used for verification.",
    "STIPULATIONS": "Thread will be held by BanklessDAO for 6 months.\n\nSale of tokens: Following the six-month period, BanklessDAO has the right to sell the token on respective markets.\n\n\nCommunications around the partnership:\n\nTo ensure operational effectiveness, a bi-monthly call may be set up by at least one representative of each organization.",
    "RISKS": "The WEAV token could become worthless if WeavrDAO fails to create and retain value.\nThe maximum loss would be each investor’s proportional interest in the funding target.",
    "SUCCESS METRICS OR KPIS": "Hit the crowdfunding target of needle.\nSuccessful conducted marketing & education campaigns."
